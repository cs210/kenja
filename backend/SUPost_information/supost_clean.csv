"Free Living Spaces Couch, Gold, Good Condition - Free
         @stanford.edu","Hi all,


I'm starting a new job in Seattle and giving away my furniture to the community as a thank you for the last decade living here. My last remaining item unclaimed is my couch. It's in very good condition, comfortable, and most importantly, free. There are some small areas of paint staining on the legs (see pictured). I love it and I wish I could bring it with me. Link to the original in a different color:

"2010 Subaru Forester AWD Manual Transmission - $7,800
         @stanford.edu","Hi! We're a couple of Stanford postdocs reluctantly parting ways with our beloved Subaru Forester as we prepare to return to Spain. We bought it in February 2023, and we're its second proud owners. Previously, it belonged to a family from France who, like us, were relocating.


The car has been diligently maintained, with service primarily handled at Subaru in Stevens Creek, San Jose, where it was originally purchased. Consequently, it has remained registered in California throughout its lifespan.

It comes with a clean title, has passed smog test and has a registration valid until the end of 2024.


Here are the vital stats:

•	Model: Forester 2.5X Pzev

•	Fuel type: Gasoline

•	Transmission: Manual

•	Drivetrain: AWD 

•	Mileage: 119,000 miles


Recent reparations:

•	Clutch: Replaced in 2018

•	Battery 2 years and 5 months old (Dec 2021)

•	Timing belt, water pump, tensioner, idler: Replaced 2021

•	Tires: Replaced at 87804 miles


This Forester is ready for its next adventure, whether it's cruising through city streets or tackling off-road trails.


Contact us for more information and photos! We're hoping to find a new owner within the Stanford community, so please reach out using your Stanford email.


Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a piece of Subaru excellence!","$7,800","Wed, May 08, 2024 03:22 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129992662

"2016 Kia Rio EX (79k miles) - $11,000
         @stanford.edu","Hi everyone, my name is Dylan. My wife and I purchased this car in 2019 when we were in graduate school, and it has served us extremely well over the last few years. We recently finished our postdoc appointments at Stanford, and we're now preparing to move to the east coast. As much as we want to bring the car with us, we figured our move would be easier if we sold it. We're hoping to find it a new home before we leave!


Some information about the car:


• 2016 Kia Rio EX

• VIN: KNADM4A36G6654978

• 79,000 miles

• We don't smoke, and we don't use air fresheners or other artificial scents. Also, no animals have been in the car.

• The AC, heating, and sound system / speakers are fully functional.

• The interior of the car is clean and un-damaged. There are no rips in the interior fabric. We've purchased and used seat covers in the driver and passenger seats since owning the car.

• There is no damage to the outside of the car, and the car has never been in an accident. There are a few small chips in the paint near the back bumper.


I recently took the car to Firestone Auto Care in Redwood City for a full vehicle inspection to make sure it was in good condition, and I'd be happy to provide you with a copy of the vehicle inspection report.


If possible, would prefer payment in cash.

In my personal experience this bike has been a smooth ride, just small for me. There are lights installed on the front and back included. There is also a lock holder installed and a water bottle holder which could be cool if you work out on it (haha). The description above wasn’t lying tho, it’s a super light bike with strong breaks and powerful gears. If you need a good commuter bike or just need a bike to get around campus, this could be a good option :)

Title: Clean title

4 new tires (just changed)

New LED headlight

Oil change (last month)

I have cleaned the blanket inside the car with cleaner!


Weakness:

The front and the rear of the car have minor signs of collision, which were made by the previous owner; it was like this when I bought it.


Strength:

1. It's economic. (The entire cost of this car is just enough to cover the repair of the bumper of another car after an accident.). 3000$ can just buy a computer(like macbook).


2. For a car of that year, the mileage is quite low; it took me a long time to find this car for daily commuting.

         @stanford.edu","This Serena & Lily Pacifica outdoor dining table has served us well over the last year and a half, but we’re moving and the table is just too large for the new place. The table has been kept outside but covered since purchased in late 2022. It goes for $2500 new and is currently on sale on the Serena & Lily website for $2000. I’m asking $1400. Please see the website for all details about dimensions, materials, design, etc. The table has a pretty heavy glass top and I’d recommend transporting it without separating the top from bottom if possible. That said, they likely need to be separated to get out of my yard. Requires two people to move—I’m happy to be the second, but you’ll need a uhaul or truck of some kind.

Originally purchased for $1,699, this mattress has been lovingly maintained in a pet-free, smoke-free home and is in excellent condition.


Key Features:


Eco-Friendly Materials: Made with natural and organic materials, including organic cotton, natural latex, and New Zealand wool, offering a breathable, comfortable, and sustainable sleep experience.

"Car for sale: Saturn Aura - $8,000
         @stanford.edu","I'm selling my beloved 2008 Saturn Aura. It's been a fantastic car, very reliable and low running costs. I'm the second owner and have had it for about three years.


The highlights:

* 4 door sedan, silver color, 200-something horsepower gas engine.

* 125k miles. No accidents or other issues.

* Heated seats, automatic headlights, and a few other similar comfort features.

* Upgraded with rear camera, bluetooth audio, and Apple Carplay / Android Auto, as well as a 24/7 dashcam.

* Upgraded front speakers from JBL.


The car has been super reliable, and a very nice car for road trips etc. (I drove here from the east coast with it!)

It has had super low running and mainenance cost - all the parts are very common standard GM parts, so whenever anything did need replacing, it was always very affordable (much cheaper than I've heard from friends with newer cars for similar jobs). I just had brand new brakes and tire pressure sensors installed a week ago as well, so I expect that it won't need any major maintenance in a while. It also just passed smog inspection, so you'd be all set to go straight to registering it!


For the sake of full transparency, the price I'm asking is a bit higher than KBB value for the car, as I've had a few upgrades done. In particular a rear camera & Apple Carplay dashboard, which really make the car feel like a very modern one.


If you're interested let me know and I'd be happy to meet on or around campus for a test drive.","$8,000","Sun, Apr 07, 2024 03:21 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129990757

Stanford soon. I bought the bike used from its previous owner in November 2022

While this is a mountain bike, I only used it for my daily commute 

from Menlo Park to Stanford campus and back. It was perfect for this purpose. 


This is not a new bike and it shows the expected wear and tear. 


Gears and breaks in good condition. 


I never used it off road, and it would probably require some tune-up if you 

really would want to do serious trail biking with it. But if you only need it 

for getting around town/campus, it works well.


I can also provide you with a lock/helmet/lights included in the price.

"2007 Suzuki SX4, 84k miles, Great condition (Discounted!) - $6,400
         @stanford.edu","I am selling 2007 SUZUKI SX4 (Red, Hatchback 4WD) with 84,000 miles in great condition. Please contact me if you are interested. The details are as follows:


-Purchased from previous owner in September 2021. (I'm the 4th owner)

-Passed smog check this February.

-Two front tires were replaced last September and two rear tires were replaced this January. (Both have warranty against failure due to punctures, etc.; each tire has about 50,000-mile lifespan).

-Replaced two front windshield wipers last December.

-Oil and brakes checked last September.

-No accidents.


Some paint is peeling but exterior has no dents or major scratches. The interior of the car is very clean, with hardly any damage or stains on the seats. The trunk has also been covered with cardboard since purchase, so there are hardly any scratches.


As a precaution, the tire pressure light is on even though there is nothing wrong with the tire pressure. The manufacturer confirmed that the tire pressure sensors on the front left and rear right wheels seem to be malfunctioning. We haven't replaced the sensors for now because they cost $300/unit and it was unclear whether the warning light would go out even if they were replaced. The tires are not affected by this problem, and there is no problem at all if you check the pressure regularly at a tire store. (Inspection is free)


Asking price is based on Kelly Blue Book's private sale range, considering low mileage, very good condition, and new parts. Cigar sockets for USB insertion and a drive recorder are included. The DMV registration sticker is valid until Feb 2025. DMV registration sticker is valid until Feb 2025 (next smog check is in Feb 2026).


We hope to handover the car around March 27. Please feel free to contact us for a test drive or if you have any other questions.","$6,400","Sun, Mar 10, 2024 11:20 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129989275

"7-speed Schwinn Bike for sale (with basket and fenders) - $250
         @stanford.edu","Hi,


I bought this bike in January and was riding it ~20 miles every day for about a month. :)

Now I got a racing bike that I can also use on longer weekend rides so I don't need it anymore.


Both of the breaks work, it has a basket (which has a small hole on one side. It didn't bother me but if it's a problem it's repairable with some wire) and fenders on front and back tire (no muddy pants!! wuhuu!). It's a 7-speed bike but the lowest gear doesn't work, so it runs like a 6-speeder.

         @stanford.edu","I am selling 2007 SUZUKI SX4 (Red, Hatchback 4WD) with 84,000 miles in great condition. Please contact me if you are interested. The details are as follows:


Purchased from previous owner in September 2021. (I'm the 4th owner)

Passed smog check this February.

Two front tires were replaced last September and two rear tires were replaced this January. (Both have warranty against failure due to punctures, etc.; each tire has about 50,000-mile lifespan).

Replaced two front windshield wipers last December.

Oil and brakes checked last September.

No accidents.


Some paint is peeling but exterior has no dents or major scratches. The interior of the car is very clean, with hardly any damage or stains on the seats. The trunk has also been covered with cardboard since purchase, so there are hardly any scratches.


As a precaution, the tire pressure light is on even though there is nothing wrong with the tire pressure. The manufacturer confirmed that the tire pressure sensors on the front left and rear right wheels seem to be malfunctioning. We haven't replaced the sensors for now because they cost $300/unit + it was unclear whether the warning light would go out even if they were replaced. The tires are not affected by the problem, and if the air pressure is checked regularly at a tire store, there is no problem at all. (Inspection is free)


Asking price is based on Kelly Blue Book's private sale range, considering low mileage, very good condition, and new parts. Cigar sockets for USB insertion and a drive recorder are included. The DMV registration sticker is valid until Feb 2025. DMV registration sticker is valid until Feb 2025 (next smog check is in Feb 2026).


We hope to handover the car around March 27. Please feel free to contact us for a test drive or if you have any other questions.","$7,200","Sat, Mar 02, 2024 04:36 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129988861

"Australian Shepard Dog for Adoption - Free
         @stanford.edu","My wife and I are currently fostering a very sweet Australian Shepherd named Butters who's looking for his forever home! If you or anyone you know may be interested in adopting Butters, please reach out! Please see below for a review of our first week with Butters:


Butters has settled into our home almost right away, and aside from 2 accidents on the first day, he's got into a great routine and only goes to potty outside. If he does need to go outside of the routine, he will indicate by going to the door and giving a soft paw. We've bathed him at the local pet shop, trimmed his nails and matted patches and he did very well with both. He loves all the pampering and melts at our feet whenever he sees the brush. He plays great with our resident dog and although getting a little excited and pulling towards other dogs on leash, he has done well at politely greeting dogs on walks so far. He settles very well in the crate and can be left for around 6h during the day or longer overnight without any accidents. He has also come to work with my wife a couple of days a week and settles in his crate or by her feet after exploring the new space.


Right now, we're working on slow introductions to new people as past trauma has made him wary of fast approaches over the head, but with plenty of treats (did we mention he's very treat motivated?!), he's learning to trust new people very quickly, after just a couple of interactions. We're also working on leash training, sit, stay, down, wait, leave it, paw, touch and stay after just a week at our place. He's smart and he learns quickly, and he's eager to please with positive and neutral reinforcement. He's a medium-energy dog who needs one good walk and some mental stimulation, but also settles in the house very well and absolutely loves snuggles and belly rubs, so will cosy up on the couch in the evenings!


Please see more information about Butters here: 
https://www.shelterluv.com/embed/animal/MILO-A-5716


You will also need to fill out an adoption form with the Milo Foundation here just to make sure you are eligible to adopt:

I bought this used in Sep 2023 and tuned it up, put in new tubes front and back, wheel truing, and added the rear rack and basket. I used this bike to commute to school until Nov 2023 before upgrading. Nowadays it’s just a spare bike that I ride to buy groceries.


The bike is in good condition, but the chain sometimes slips off the front sprocket when shifting gears, so a derailleur adjustment may be needed. Everything else works fine (brakes, pedals, steering). Little to no rust on all the parts, and I will lube the chain again before selling.

         @stanford.edu","This laptop is fully functional and in 99.9% near-mint condition. There is only 1 scratch on the front base where the lid meets the base. You will not see it during normal use. In fact, it was very difficult to get a photo of it. Please see photos for more details: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fE_IrsaVM2h4UamJGRpZDuEwvzinUhXR?usp=sharing


Highlights include:

- Extremely lightweight at 2.2lb or .99kg. Feels like you are carrying nothing in a backpack, or even when holding it in your hands! For reference, a 2020 MacBook Air is 2.8lb.

- Fast and snappy thanks to the Ryzen 7 5800U processor with tons of cores and threads.

- Handles multiple applications running very well thanks to 16GB of RAM.

- Very bright screen at above 400 nits. For reference, a 2020 MacBook Air also gets as bright as 400 nits.

- Also, the display is 16:10 ratio, so you get more vertical screen for long documents and code.

- Also, the display has a very high resolution of WQXGA (2560 x 1600). The screen looks very crisp.

- Also, the display has great color accuracy at 99% sRGB, so colors are accurate!

- This is subject, but I really like the keyboard's feel.


There exist many positive reviews of this laptop online. The most common praise is that it punches above its weight in performance and physical quality at the MSRP of $850. 
https://www.google.com/search?q=hp+pavilion+aero+13+ryzen+7+5800u+review


IMPORTANT NOTE: The keyboard is Spanish. You can still use English keyboard settings with Windows though. All the letters are in the same place as an US English keyboard. Symbols and some text will be Spanish-specific. This never bothered me since I remember the US keyboard layout by memory.


Still has 1 month left on factory warranty, in the very unfortunate event that something goes wrong during that time. You can check the serial with HP: 8CG14909Y0


Specs are as follows.

CPU: Ryzen 7 5800U (8 cores, 16 threads)

RAM: 16GB LPDDR4

SSD: 512GB NVMe (Intel 660p)

GPU: AMD Radeon Graphics

Weight: 2.2lbs / .99kg

"Great umbrella - $10
         @stanford.edu","This is no ordinary umbrella; only $2^90, more than the size of the universe. But listen before you judge! This Habibi  has witnessed both sunny and stormy days. What I can assure you is that I've taken great care of it, reflecting who I am. Fueled by love and kindness, I share these with those who deserve it and understand its true value. With a free, uncontrolled spirit, I wander the globe, relishing planned or unexpected journeys, be it from a bar or a spontaneous city stroll (as long as there's a welcoming shower at night). Yes, this umbrella has been my constant companion throughout. Don't just focus on its shiny beautiful exterior; if you're fortunate, open it and witness the unspoken, beautiful journey it encapsulates! Just a heads up, akin to my whimsical Lucid gravity, delivery might take you to Brazil, Costa Rica, Germany, or even close to home in UTAH! The umbrella's fact shows (similar to Carfax), a single owner, as I don’t need anyone to hold an umbrella anymore but just enjoy my company and see the world with me (or that restaurant I have been trying to get to). My head might feel a bit bum bum bum in the morning, but I hope it was due to good company the night before!

         @stanford.edu","This laptop is fully functional and in 99.9% near-mint condition. There is only 1 scratch on the front base where the lid meets the base. You will not see it during normal use. In fact, it was very difficult to get a photo of it. Please see photos for more details: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fE_IrsaVM2h4UamJGRpZDuEwvzinUhXR?usp=sharing


Highlights include:

- Extremely lightweight at 2.2lb or .99kg. Feels like you are carrying nothing in a backpack, or even when holding it in your hands! For reference, a 2020 MacBook Air is 2.8lb.

- Fast and snappy thanks to the Ryzen 7 5800U processor with tons of cores and threads.

- Handles multiple applications running very well thanks to 16GB of RAM.

- Very bright screen at above 400 nits. For reference, a 2020 MacBook Air also gets as bright as 400 nits.

- Also, the display is 16:10 ratio, so you get more vertical screen for long documents and code.

- Also, the display has a very high resolution of WQXGA (2560 x 1600). The screen looks very crisp.

- Also, the display has great color accuracy at 99% sRGB, so colors are accurate!

- This is subject, but I really like the keyboard's feel.


There exist many positive reviews of this laptop online. The most common praise is that it punches above its weight in performance and physical quality at the MSRP of $850.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The keyboard is Spanish. You can still use English keyboard settings with Windows though. All the letters are in the same place as an US English keyboard. Symbols and some text will be Spanish-specific. This never bothered me since I remember the US keyboard layout by memory.


Still has 1 month left on factory warranty, in the very unfortunate event that something goes wrong during that time. You can check the serial with HP: 8CG14909Y0

It has 130k miles on it, and likely has significant life remaining.


Moonroof makes driving in summers delightful in California, which was my primary motivation to buy this vehicle ;) 


It has been well taken care of by previous owners and myself. I have done regular tune-ups and maintenance, replaced all the brakes last year before a trip to Santa Barbara (costed $1200). I will provide all the maintenance records to interested buyer.


It has recently passed smog test so the buyer need not worry about it for another two years.


I'm selling it for a very fair price. Hoping to sell it before the end of this year, since that's when the registration is getting over.","$5,000","Mon, Dec 18, 2023 02:48 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129985499

They are in great condition and I have maintained them with technical servicing at REI. Skis and boots can be sold separately, however, this is best used as a high-quality kit, and if bought together, I will throw in the poles and a pair of goggles. I have absolutely loved these skis and have enjoyed them on all kinds of terrain from deep powder, to forests, to parks. I especially like the twin tips, which have served me well for learning to spin and to ski backwards! 


Details:


Skis + bindings ($310 if sold separately): K2 Sight 169cm. These skis are lightweight, agile, and fitted for mountain maneuvers. They’ll take you wherever you want to go from groomed trails, to the park, to off-piste.

         @stanford.edu","Bought them a couple of years back to keep up with my climbing, but my gym shut down, and they've been collecting dust ever since. They're basically brand new, tags still hanging on, and not a single wear.


Check out the pics for proof. Originally bought them at REI for $89 + tax ($97 or so), but I'm letting them go for $69.99. Perfect for anyone looking to dive into climbing or if you're already a bit of a pro.

GORGEOUS selection of colors, styles, designs, fabrics, patterns, intricate handwork (brocade/embroidery or sequins). (Unable to display photos of entire selection, due to constantly-changing stock and Craigslist's limitation on the number of photos. I have an inventory of about 80 outfits.)


Stop by to see the full collection! VERY reasonable prices, starting at $10 and up, depending on intricacy of work on each outfit. LARGE range of outfits in the $10-$25 price range.

I am selling my Raleigh City bike that I bought new in June 2024 (I am leaving the country).

I am 5' 7 (170 cm) and fit comfortably on the bike. The bike is super light and can be easily lifted. I installed a Hexlox lock so that the front wheel and the saddle can't be easily unscrewed and stolen (you will only need to lock bike frame and back wheel). I can add a helmet and a lock if needed.


The bike can be picked up on Stanford campus or at 94301 Palo Alto.",$375,"Sun, Nov 26, 2023 09:36 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129984489

"60"" 4k UHD SMASUNG Smart TV - $250
         @stanford.edu","Hi!


I would like to get rid of my 4k UHD TV.


About the TV:

It is a Direct LED TV from 2017 with 4k UHD resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR support (does not seem to be compatible with some ps5 games, if used for gaming). Perfect for streaming!


You can look up the specs in more detail here: 
https://www.samsclub.com/p/60-uhd-smart-tv-120hz-3-hdmi-wifi/prod20321985


Condition:

The tv is in excellent condition, besides a minor scratch at the bottom left corner. I already bought it with this scratch from Samsung and can honestly say that I could never even tell while watching or gaming on it. You can only see it when the tv is switched off and you know exactly where to look from a close distance.

"Beloved MANUAL audi A4 (2006) - $2,000
         @stanford.edu","2006 Audi A4 turbo (MANUAL) looking for a new home (MUST DRIVE STICK)  


150,000 miles, still purring  


This four-door sedan has been in my family since 2006. It is a beautiful car, with a powerful engine, cared for with devotion. As I learned how to drive on this car and in a sense came of age with it and then a decade later drove it cross-country to CA I will part with it somewhat RELUCTANTLY I hope that its new owner will give it the SWEET sweet tender love and care it deserves. I was recently gifted a newer car, and can't afford to keep two on my insurance. alas, it's time to sell.   


Negatives: The car is leaking oil. I’ve driven it for over a year with the oil leak (drops in the driveway, adding a quart of oil when it gets low), but you’ll probably want to address it (although the engine has never overheated). The main leak is below the oil filter housing, which would cost about $1000 to replace. So either you live with the oil, or you replace the oil filter housing, up to you. I'll pass along the full mechanics report, of course, which I have from Stress Free Autocare in Mtn View (Paul there specializes in German engines). There are other things you could fix: low-hanging fruit, clean the battery terminal ($30). There's rust on the underbody. Oh! The batteries in the car key are dead I think? I just open it manually.    


Positives: In addition to the buttery smooth miles it shifts like a dream. Heated seats, excellent gas mileage if you keep it around 65-70, four-wheel drive, change the oil regularly and the stallion engine will last a long while 


Notes: The price is negotiable - obviously I'd like to recoup the money for the smog test ($100ish) and a repair I recently made to stop the worst of the oil leak ($500). I would like the car to go to the right person/family. Oh! The car takes premium gas. PREMIUM GAS. Not regular, no regular gas.  


I have the title, Smog test (July 19th 2023), and a mechanic’s report ready to go. I would love to minimize the back-and-forth, so I'll be especially interested in hearing from people who are ready to take it and drive!","$2,000","Mon, Sep 18, 2023 04:43 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129980929

"2014 BMW 3 SERIES 320I - $15,000
         @stanford.edu","I'm selling my beloved BMW 2014 320i (white). It's in fantastic condition with only 64K miles. I purchased it in late August 2021 from the dealer and most recently had it serviced by BMW last week alongside a new battery. The only reason I'm parting with it is because I've had to move countries for work and hence my partner will be selling it on my behalf. I love it so much I even contemplated getting it shipped to where we live now - but unfortunately it won't work as we drive on the other side of the road. :( 


Key details:

- I bought it at Fremont Mazda in August 2021.

- Limited miles since purchase as I was a student and mainly driving around campus.

- Serviced last week (9/2023) alongside replacing with new battery.

- Competitively priced vs. other listings


You will receive the following with the car:

1. One set of keys.

2. Original booklets that came with the car.

3. Title and deed, etc.

4. Service receipt (9/2023).

5. CARFAX history report (9/2023).


Other things we love about the car:

1. Premium leather seats interior.

2. Car door handles light up.

3. No scratches, paint looks fresh.


Let me know if you are interested or want more information!


PS. The blue stickers on the windshield are no longer there; it was like that at the dealer.

"Vintage Road Bike Specialized Allez Epic - $300
         @stanford.edu","Selling my beloved vintage road bike because I now need one that fits a rack. It's a vintage Specialized Allez Epic which I bought from its original owner 3 years ago.


It has its original Shimano brake and gear components, and has 2x7 speeds. A year ago I gave it a full maintenance and changed the rear tire. For reference I'm 5'10'' and I'd say I'm on the shorter end of the ideal rider size for the bike's size.


It's been used lightly, mostly for short daily commutes around campus, but has normal wear and tear. Most notably it probably needs new brake grips, seat and taking care of small rust spots in the frame, as shown in pictures. This has been taking into account for the price, but I'm willing to hear offers.",$300,"Fri, Sep 01, 2023 06:44 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129979895

I traveled the country in this baby, from SF to Atlanta and back, and many spots in between, and it served as a noble and reliable steed, in the cold and heat. It has been worked on by 2 top mechanics, one in the North Bay Area, and one in Houston who was voted the top bus mechanic in the area.


It has been smogged, the title is clean, and it includes a small kitchenette, bed/couch space. It comes with:

Fridge

Kitchen supplies

Pillows

Blankets

New rear brakes added

Privacy curtain

Reading lights

First aid

Table

Original Chairs

Portable battery

Vintage 90s vibes


It has basically everything you would need for your own adventure, or van life set up. There are a couple of issues that need some TLC: the paint is peeling on the right side, there's a small power leak with the auxiliary battery, and the right channel speakers need to be adjusted. But functionally it’s ready for a new adventure around the country, and I would do it myself if I wasn't moving to a new setup in life.","$9,900","Wed, Aug 16, 2023 10:41 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129978844

"Car moving help (short gig, involves driving)
         @stanford.edu","I’m moving out of the Bay Area and shipping my car across the country. I would like the car to arrive around the end of August, but I’m leaving the Bay next week. As a result, I’m looking for some help with coordinating car pickup after I've left the Bay.


Specifically, I’m looking for a trustworthy, safe driver in or around San Francisco to do the following:


1
. Work with me to find a 3-day window between August 20-31, during which the car shipper will pick up my car, and you are available to drop off the car to where it needs to be picked up.

2
. Arrange for me to handoff the car keys and a garage door opener to you, likely via a lockbox in SF.

3
. During that 3 day window, be available to drive my car from the garage in SF it’s parked in, to the car shipping truck’s meeting point (shouldn’t be a long drive). The shipper will call you and you will take the car to the pickup location they specify.

4
. Take the garage door opener to a USPS office and mail it. I will leave an addressed cushioned envelope in my car for you to use. It can NOT be dropped off in a mailbox due to its size. I’ll reimburse you for the postage for the garage door opener.

"2007 Volkswagen Jetta Wolfsburg Edition Sedan 4D - $4,200
         @stanford.edu","We have owned this car for the past 3 years, and it’s been a reliable commuter car (SF to Stanford this year 3x / week). Only selling it because we are moving cross country after graduation. Nice leather seats, great sound system (with phone aux), sunroof, strong AC, efficient mileage. Purchased from a Stanford grad student 3 years ago.


No accidents, runs well so no immediate work needed. Just expect the occasional maintenance costs that comes with an older car. Over the past year put on a fresh new set of tires (all 4), new brake pads, and new battery, and we have done regular oil changes. We've been going to the Car Doctor in Palo Alto when we needed anything, they've been great!


Small things that are wrong with it: horn doesn’t work (fixable for a few hundred bucks, never got around to getting it fixed), and one of the back doors doesn’t unlock from the outside (i.e have to open it from inside the car, car is 'extra secure' I guess).

"Selling an ebike with all accessories - $560
         @stanford.edu","Hello,

Since I moved and have to had a car 1 month before and found no need of this great ebike anymore, so I decide to sell it. I got it last November from Amazon and used it for about 6 months. I maintained it very carefully and it's still in the perfect state. I had oil on the gear so it's very quiet. The seat is super soft and feel no pressure during biking. You may have a test ride near the research park.


You will have all the accessories for biking, including a helmet, a lock, a very bright headlight, a tyre pump and a toolkit for patching the tyre. The Li-ion battery is removeable, so you can charge it anywhere. 


It's a great choice for commuting within 7 miles from campus (30 min). Especially, if you have to bike along some long slopes, it will help you a lot. 


This ebike's Amazon link is as below, a new one will cost you $699+20+tax and 1-2 hours for installment. All the accessories cost about $150. So I'm asking $560 OBO.

"Indoor Sunny Spinning Bike + great gear! - $125
         @stanford.edu","Selling a like-new Sunny B1509 spinning bike with add-ons included to provide a turnkey indoor spinning experience for a fraction of the price of the well-known competition. This Sunny B1509 is like new, was purchased in 2021 and used several times/week for a year during pandemic lock-down (in a smoke-free, animal-free home). She has been well-maintained, the pad regularly oiled, and wiped clean after every ride. No issues whatsoever - I loved the bike and the riding experience it offers; just moved back to outside running and want the floor space back so it's an opportunity for someone else to enjoy her as much as I have.


Here's the article that inspired me to purchase this bike and the gear I’m including with the sale: 
https://www.sippingandshopping.org/my-peloton-bike-alternative/


Included with the sale are great like-new add-ons to offer you a complete spinning experience:   1) a handlebar holder for an iPad/iPhone ($14 new), 2) Wahoo cadence and speed sensors ($60 new), 3) a custom resistance indicator (you just need to add a new rubber band) ($27 new); 4) SPD clips ($10) and pedals, and 5) if your women’s shoe size 8.5, a like-new pair of Gavin women’s indoor riding shoes with SPD clips, size 41 ($40 new).

All of this can be yours for just $125.00 (cash only).  If you purchased all of this new today you’d spend well over $300 AND you’d have to assemble the bike (a time-consuming afternoon!).


The bike is in a carport – easy for you to load and go. Might be a two person job for loading.


Cash only, you load and haul.

         @stanford.edu","Bought in Nov 2017 (original price $800). Thoroughly cleaned and in original box with height-adjustable stand and connecting cables (1×HDMI, 1×mDP-to-DP, 1×USB 3.0 upstream cable). I used this monitor until recently for work, gaming and watching movies/shows and just replaced it against a bigger, 38” monitor. It has a matte IPS panel with good image quality (and no hot or dead pixels), TONs of ports (2× HDMI, 2× DP, 1×mDP, 2 USB 3.0 A ports on underside, 2 USB 3.0 A ports on the side and two USB 3.0 upstream ports for KVM function - to use the screen and any attached periphery with two computers). The display has some backlight-bleeding in the corners which is standard for these ultra-wide monitors and is only really notable in a darkened room and when having a black background. It also has two integrated speakers about which quality I cannot say anything because I never used them. Please note that I used an adjustable monitor arm which is on the images but not included (already given away), the standard monitor stand is included.

         @stanford.edu","11GB GDDR6 iCX2 RGB LED

Model-No.: 11G-P4-2487-KR 

Original price in 2018: $1471


This card served me well in my gaming PC since November 2018. It works like a charm and has never been additionally overclocked (run on EVGA's factory settings) and was used in a smoke- and pet-free household and got a canned-air clean after removal from the PC. The card got replaced by an RTX3090 in 2022, which I was able to get for the original price via EVGA's waiting list. It comes in the original box with original accessories (an HDMI-to-DVI adapter cable). 


Manufacturer specs: 
https://www.evga.com/Products/Specs/GPU.aspx?pn=e4340236-ea51-4c90-972b-d543bf3918e0
 


The card is registered with EVGA and has 5 years extended warranty (so until Dec 2023). As far as I know, this extended warranty cannot be transferred but I will be around at least until end of the year and can offer to handle the RMA in case there should any defects appear later on.

I'm selling my beloved Canon T6 camera with a 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 IS II, and 70-300 f/3.5-5.6 lens. It's a great camera to get into and learn photography. Along with this, I'll throw in 2 extra camera batteries and a 2 battery chargers, and a lens hood which works for both lens. Basically, this kit would give you everything to go out there in the world and start clicking pictures! I'm selling this because I'm upgrading my equipment and making space. 

There is a minor cosmetic scratch on the screen of the camera, but there is no dust, fungal, oil issues with either the camera or lenses. The sensor and batteries are in great condition!

1. Self-hosting A LOT applications (like a server), including websites, DNS servers, router software, backups, etc. 14 cores / 28 threads and 128GB of RAM will do that. I used Proxmox as a hypervisor and ran many VMs on it without issue.

2. Llight-mid gaming with the Quadro P2000.

3. General use. You can open so many Chrome tabs on this computer.


Plenty of open PCIe slots for expanding storage or ports. Cosmetically, it has signs of wear but nothing major. Please see photos in this Google Drive link for details: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1syQiNlje1djxoXzks5I8rKhQWwQEJGz8?usp=share_link


I am selling this because I downsized my server since I no longer need to self-host a ton of applications. I’m hoping someone else can get better use out of this computer.

"Oura Smart Ring (Heritage - Silver) Size 8 - $130
         @stanford.edu","This is an Oura Smart Ring! It’s a ring that can monitor heart rate, sleep, and activity.


It is used but fully functional. Cosmetically, it has signs of wear common with normal use. Battery life is still great. I can get 2 days easily, but often charge it daily since the battery is so small.


I am selling it because I find it is redundant to use since I already have an Apple Watch. This is great if you want health features but do not care for smartwatches (or wear a watch at all).


It feels like any other ring, but has some outdents in the interior for health sensors.


I highly recommend checking out the official website for more details.

"Oura Smart Ring (Heritage Silver) - Size 8 - $150
         @stanford.edu","This is an Oura Smart Ring! It’s a ring that can monitor heart rate, sleep, and activity.


It is used but fully functional. Cosmetically, it has signs of wear common with normal use. Battery life is still great. I can get 2 days easily, but often charge it daily since the battery is so small.


I am selling it because I find it is redundant to use since I already have an Apple Watch. This is great if you want health features but do not care for smartwatches (or wear a watch at all).


It feels like any other ring, but has some outdents in the interior for health sensors.


I highly recommend checking out the official website for more details.

Looking for one roommate in downtown Sunnyvale!,"Hi everyone!! 


Apologies for the double post, but we are looking for one more person to fill a 3 bed/2.5 bath apartment in Sunnyvale at the Flats at Cityline! Floor plan is attached. The complex is right in the heart of downtown Sunnyvale, and walking distance from Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Safeway, Target (you get your pick of grocery stores!!), AMC Theaters (and all of Downtown Sunnyvale tbh), and the CalTrain station! There is also a farmers market that comes on Saturday mornings in the area as well. No rooms are set in stone just yet, so if you really want the master (or really don’t!), please don’t hesitate to reach out.


Total rent for the unit is approx. 
 $5000 plus utilities, as well as the security deposit.
 We are hoping to move in around July 28, but could move in earlier if needed.


 Apartment website:
 
https://citylineflats.com


 A little about me:
 I work at Stanford as an equipment manager for their athletics department! Meaning I’ll work from the office most days, as well as some weekends. When I’m not working, I love watching sports (please ask me about fantasy football), going out for food and drinks with friends, as well as playing videogames and watching movies!


 A little about C:
 She is an administrative professional in biotech who works from home mostly. When she’s not working, she’s a fan of books, museums, and action movies (Marvel anyone???), and absolutely loves good weather and good food.


We’ll be joined by a little 
9 year old pup named Donut (pictures also attached!).
 She’s one of the easiest dogs in the world—she loves to eat, sleep, watch tv, and will cuddle LITERALLY anyone. Even moreso if you give her some treats! Sadly, we can’t house any additional pets.


If this is something you think you might be interested in, feel free to message me either here or on Instagram

"2012 Audi S5 4.2 quattro Premium Plus Coupe AWD - $17,500
         @stanford.edu","Experience exhilarating performance and luxurious style with the 2012 Audi S5, a testament to its exceptional condition and remarkable freshness. This sleek coupe, equipped with a powerful 354 hp 4.2L V8 engine, will leave you captivated from the moment you get behind the wheel.


Key Features:

●Mileage: 105,192

●Transmission: Automatic

●Drivetrain: All-Wheel Drive

●Safety: ABS brakes, Curtain airbags, Driver airbag, Front side airbags, Passenger airbag

●Options: Alloy Wheels, B&O audio, Bluetooth, Heated Seats, Leather Seats, Sunroof


https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ocEiZ48L4-8aVOo_SgvS43bn3Bt02YWw/view?usp=sharing


●I want to highlight that the front brake pads and rotors have been recently replaced less than a year ago, ensuring excellent braking performance. The car has also undergone regular maintenance, and I have consistently used high-quality engine oil for optimal engine health.


●To provide extra value, I am pleased to offer three bottles of premium engine oil and a fuel system cleaner as an additional bonus with the purchase of the car. These items will help you maintain the vehicle's performance and ensure its longevity. Rest assured that the car has been well cared for, and these recent maintenance updates, along with the included maintenance products, further demonstrate my commitment to providing a quality vehicle for its new owner.


●Add an ""S"" to any Audi model name and you generally increase the entertainment factor. The 2012 Audi S5 is a prime example. The S5 benefits from a supercharged burly V8 engine and more athletic handling. Yet the S5 is still balanced, with an easy-to-drive nature and styling that deftly combines sensuous curves, an aggressive stance and understated luxury.


●Out on the road, the Audi S5 is a joy to drive. Whether it's slicing through twisting canyon roads or logging serious touring miles, it manages to deliver just the right mix of athleticism and luxury. Drivers may also choose between coupe or soft-top convertible models. Both body styles are similarly equipped, though the coupe receives the sonorous V8. Many enthusiasts will likely find the coupe more to their liking, not just for the extra cylinders, but also because it's the only one offered with a six-speed manual transmission.


●Inside, the S5 treats me to a high-quality cabin that is typical of the Audi brand. Materials quality is top-notch and the latest electronics are pleasing to casual users and early adopters alike. The sport seats are sure to gain favor as well, with plenty of lateral support and cosseting comfort for a variety of driving preferences. And while the soft-top convertible may seem outdated when compared to more modern folding hardtops, the lighter multilayer construction keeps the cabin quiet and folds away neatly without completely devouring trunk space.


▶▶▶With stunning good looks and stirring performance, it's easy to see why the Audi S5 our favorites.

I scheduled the test at Santa Clara DMV on Monday, July 24th, 3.20pm, but it might be possible to reschedule if you're interested and the time/day doesn't work for you. 


Usually they're slow at the DMV so I anticipate this taking between 2-3 hours of your afternoon.

I can compensate you for borrowing your bike, but not any higher than the cost of a used bike. I'm not buying one because I'll be studying abroad next school year and don't want to have to deal with selling it later.

Also comes with a free mattress, medium firm.


I have used the bed for 9 months and bought it used from a previous resident. The frame has some scuff marks but is in good shape, all 4 drawers roll well and offer great storage. The mattress has some minor dye stains; I've used it with a mattress protector since getting it and am happy to throw in the mattress protector.


The dimensions of the mattress are 70 x 78"". I've been using a Queen sheet set with it, but a King would fit better.

https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/malm-high-bed-frame-4-storage-boxes-white-luroey-s19009500/#content


Also comes with a free mattress, medium firm.


I have used the bed for 9 months and bought it used from a previous resident. The frame has some scuff marks but is in good shape, all 4 drawers roll well and offer great storage. The mattress has some minor dye stains; I've used it with a mattress protector since getting it and am happy to throw in the mattress protector.


The dimensions of the mattress are 70 x 78"". I've been using a Queen sheet set with it, but a King would fit better.

"Light wood desk for apartment with shelves on side and metal frame - $30
         @stanford.edu","Attached are photos of the desk in my room. It's a great desk. I love it.


Here's my original text I wrote about the desk:


""Some of his magnificent qualities:

- Lightweight, but sturdy. According to the Amazon listing holds up to 100lbs. Held my heavy PC, monitor, and allll my other stuff.

- Four tiers of built-in shelves to the left of you. Can be used to display books, toys, plushies, clock, etc. You can also move them to the right hand side.

- An excellent size. I struggled for a long time searching endlessly to find a desk that I felt was deep and long enough -- it was actually incredibly hard for me to find an affordable dorm desk that was deep enough to fit my computer, keyboard, mousepad, plus books and other random crap that I keep on there. It was not overly large to be overbearing in my shared tiny Hastorf studio but not so thin and tiny that I felt it was cramped. The dimensions are 24""D x 55""W x 47""H. I am very picky about the size of a desk, and in my expert opinion, Michael is a wonderfully-sized desk.

- Incredibly stylish and lovely ""light walnut"" color with black metal legs.

- Pre-built by ME for YOU!

Attached are some photos of the desk in my home and from the online listing. Here is the Amazon link:

         @stanford.edu","Hey there, I'm selling my gray 2015 Toyota RAV4 XLE Sport Utility 4D. It's a great car, has only 61,337 miles on it, and is in great shape. It's got AWD for those rainy days and Tahoe trips, a backup camera for tight spots, and Bluetooth plus navigation to keep you connected and on track.


Never had an accident, no mechanical issues, just some minor scratches on the rear door – nothing that affects the ride. Regular maintenance has always been done at the Toyota dealership, and the big 60k miles service was done in February. That's going to save you big on maintenance down the road.


I've priced it based on KBB, Carfax, and Edmunds to keep things fair. If you're seriously interested, I can show you the Carfax report and all the maintenance records.


Check it out, it's a solid car in excellent condition. Let me know if you're interested.","$21,000","Thu, Jun 15, 2023 02:24 AM",https://supost.com/post/index/129973946

"Class 3 Electric Bicycle - $1,600
         @stanford.edu","Hello. 


I am selling my Bulls Urban Evo Pedelec Bicycle. 


This Electric bicycle is a Class 3 electric pedal assist bicycle. That means that in its highest setting, it can reach speeds up to 28mph. At its highest setting, it can go approximately 24 miles on a single charge, in its lowest setting, it can go upwards for 50 miles. 


It is incredibly fun to ride and it gets up to speed very quick. Being that it is a pedal assist only bike, there is no throttle. You provide the power and the bike amplifies it. 


The bike is in very good condition and I have had zero problems with it. I just don't ride it anymore as my commute to work has become a bit more sketchy as of late with everyone driving to work again. It was perfect for riding from Sunnyvale - Stanford every day. 


The only scuffs it has on it are from a fall I had a couple years ago. A scuff on the grips as well as the pedal bracket but other than that the paint is very good. 


I have two chargers, so that way you can have one at home and one at work if you feel so inclined. The battery is removable, so you can either charge the bike with the battery still in it or you can remove it. I also have some pannier bags I can include as well. 


The tires are still in great shape. I do believe the bike as about 1000 miles on it. Might be less. 


The picture provided is from when I got it, but if you want more recent pictures let me know.","$1,600","Tue, Jun 13, 2023 01:03 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129973686

"2012 Mazda Mazda3 Hatchback Manual SkyActiv 30MPG+ - $12,000
         @stanford.edu","This is a rare 2nd gen Mazda3 hatchback with a manual transmission and SkyActiv engine. The car is fully functional and operates without issue. I easily get 32 MPG with spirited driving, thanks to the SkyActiv engine.


I financed this car in January 2023 and have had a problem-free and fun time with it. Unfortunately, I have been having nerve issues in my left foot that prevent me from operating the clutch pedal over long periods of time. So I will be getting another car with an automatic transmission.


Cosmetically, it has signs of wear normal for a car, but it's otherwise quite nice. Interior is also in great condition. The front driver seat does have wear on the left bottom bolster, but I do have another cushion and fabric I will install before selling. Please see the (many) photos for details.


Photos / Craiglist listing: 
https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/cto/d/union-city-2012-mazda-mazda3-hatchback/7630859902.html


NOTE: The car is on loan (with payments being current, not late) with Travis Credit Union. To ensure the title transfer happens properly, we would need to complete the sale at a Travis Credit Union. There is not one in Fremont, and the closest I would go to would be 25 Crescent Dr Suite 13C, Pleasant Hill, CA 94523.


- Lien title due to loan. It is otherwise clean.

- Registration is current until July 2024.

- Passed smog.


I do have some aftermarket interior accessories installed in the car. I can leave them in there or remove / replace with stock accessories:

- VIOFO A119 front and rear dash cam, wired to the fuse box so it always stays on until the battery gets to (I think) 12.4V.

- Sony XAV-AX100 stereo with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and steering wheel remote control functionality.

- Husky Floor Liners - Weatherbeater Series (form-fitting rubber floor mats made specifically for this generation of Mazda3)

- Window rain & wind deflectors

- Rear tinted windows


Test drives in North Fremont or anywhere around Stanford or SLAC. Feel free to reach out with any questions.


Also, I do have the car is listed on Craigslist for $13K. However, selling to Stanford affiliates has historically been far less of a hassle. I am happy to give a Stanford affiliates a discount, hence why it is listed as $12K in this listing.

I purchased this bike second-hand in January from a reputable bicycle shop in San Francisco for $690, inclusive of tax. It has served me exceptionally well, but as I will fly back to Denmark, I'm looking to sell it quickly.


The bike comes with a convenient buyback guarantee from the bicycle shop, which offers you $320 (see attached picture for details).

I can genuinely attest to the bike's performance and reliability, and I'm confident it will continue to bring joy to its next owner. If you're interested, please reach out to me as soon as possible. I'm available for a call at your convenience. Act swiftly, as time is of the essence.

"60"" 4k UHD SMASUNG Smart TV - $300
         @stanford.edu","Hi!


I would like to get rid of my 4k UHD TV.


About the TV:

It is a Direct LED TV from 2017 with 4k UHD resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR support (does not seem to be compatible with some ps5 games, if used for gaming). Perfect for streaming!


You can look up the specs in more detail here: 
https://www.samsclub.com/p/60-uhd-smart-tv-120hz-3-hdmi-wifi/prod20321985


Condition:

The tv is in excellent condition, besides a minor scratch at the bottom left corner. I already bought it with this scratch from Samsung and can honestly say that I could never even tell while watching or gaming on it. You can only see it when the tv is switched off and you know exactly where to look from a close distance.

9' x 22.5'


In good but not perfect condition, with some pressures on the deck, a couple of existing watertight repairs, and an open ding on the nose. Priced accordingly! This would be a good board for a learner or someone looking to move up from a foamie – throw some duct tape on the front or get an epoxy kit to seal it!


More of a performance board, this is a fun shape with 2+1 setup that can also go as a single-fin.

Please, I need my front wheel back. My bicycle is unusable now. It has a red rim, with a disk brake. It had a quick release on it. I need my bicycle to go to the train station and go home. It was not abandoned. I don’t want anything, just the wheel back.

For safety we have just changed the brake pads.


We used the car like a camping car; two adults and a baby could sleep inside comfortably. Even if you use all seven seats, the trunk is still big enough to accommodate the stroller and many suitcases.


The car will be available from 2.7. to 4.7 in the Bay area. We will be out of the city between 06/11 and 07/01, so we invite interested people to inspect and try the car before we leave. My phone is 650-542-1699. Barbora Spalova

It's a great car - low mileage (less than 35K), and it's been recently serviced, so it's in top shape.


The lease is $900/month, which I based on monthly payments, insurance, mileage, and upkeep. If you want to chat about the price, I'm all ears.


All I ask is that you take care of it, keep it clean, and try to stick to ~1,000 miles/month (roughly 2,500 miles for the summer).

"Selling black 2015 Subaru Forester 2.0XT with 73,000 miles on it! - $13,000
         @stanford.edu","Hi all,


I am a graduating MBA student looking to sell my black 2015 Subaru Forester XT that has 73,000 miles on it!


It is in good condition, has been well-maintained over the years and I have not had any non-routine issues with it.  It should have a bunch of good miles left (Subarus have a reputation for reliability)!  It is a small SUV with 4WD and has handled all Winter conditions over a few different locations well.


I am not a big stickler on price / willing to negotiate, I'd obviously like to receive fair value for it, but I am more focused on getting it sold and transferred-over to its new owner smoothly.


If you're interested or have any questions, do give me a shout!


Best,

Jeff","$13,000","Sun, May 07, 2023 10:26 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129970625

It requires a compatible rear rack from Topeak, like the one I’m also conveniently selling (see below).

A very solid back rack, made especially great by Topeak’s pop-in accessories (like the removable wheeled basket detailed above)

"Graduation Portraits! - $100
         @stanford.edu","Congrats to everybody graduating!! I graduated with the c/o 2020 with an Art Practice degree, and I'm looking to book all of Spring Quarter with grad shoots!


I’ve had the honor of being trusted by hundreds of amazing people from every campus community to make the most powerful portraits possible to record one of life's crowning achievements. As an alum who's done this for so many years now, I'm an expert at getting creative portraits that will stand out, using every corner and angle of campus. I have the light memorized. 


Check out my full gallery with 100+ samples and see exactly what you'll be getting: 
https://www.ryanjae.com/graduations


Booking with me is a unique experience:


My standard rate includes UNLIMITED edited photos. You will get to preview every raw image we take, and pick any or all for editing. Expect a minimum of 50-100 images - I know how important it is to have options, and this way you pick your absolute favorite shot that will blow you away (which I guarantee to capture!). I show you the photos as we take them throughout the shoot!

I pride myself and specialize in getting candid off-guards, and embrace realizing ambitious creative visions - bring on the champagne, smoke bombs, confetti, biking, sports, and anything else you can come up with!

I have my own fine art printer and process by hand the highest quality fine art prints, all at a price better than a different printer

The larger the group, the lower the rate each person pays! Book with a large group of your friends - not only is it a lot of fun, but you'll get any combination of group photos on top of your individual portraits!

Book with me ASAP to secure your spot by emailing 
ryanjae@alumni.stanford.edu
, calling/texting 916-544-9332, and using my calendly (
https://calendly.com/ryanjae
). I'm local to the area and am flexible on times, just reach out and we can absolutely make it happen. Don't wait to book, I have a stole you can use!",$100,"Tue, Apr 25, 2023 02:05 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129969769

         @stanford.edu","Hi!


I would like to get rid of my 4k UHD TV.


About the TV:

It is a Direct LED TV from 2017 with 4k UHD resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR support (does not seem to be compatible with some ps5 games, if used for gaming). Perfect for streaming!


You can look up the specs in more detail here: 
https://www.samsclub.com/p/60-uhd-smart-tv-120hz-3-hdmi-wifi/prod20321985


Condition:

The tv is in excellent condition, besides a minor scratch at the bottom left corner. I already bought it with this scratch from Samsung and can honestly say that I could never even tell while watching or gaming on it.

"Two kittens in urgent need of a temp (or hopefully permanent) home! - Free
         @stanford.edu","Posted on behalf of my good friend:


Aloha Dear Sweet Family! ~ 


I am looking for a good temporary home, foster home, or full time home, or coparents for Tashi and Ziji ~ two wonderful kitties I just rescued!


They are a deeply bonded pair ~ a boy and a girl, 5 months old and 1 year old (but miniature). They are SO snuggly, sweet, and playful! They come with everything needed ~ natural untreated pine wood litter pellets (that really mitigates/ masks odors, and is not messy at all!), a covered litter box, wet food, scratcher that they love to use, and natural toys to be ordered. They are both up to date on vaccines, health, have no fleas/ ticks, and have been neutered and spayed. Ready for an indoor snuggle home... or indoor/ outdoor in the right situation (if they are safe, away from roads, predators, etc). 


It is urgently needed aid I’m requesting, as I needs to leave on travels immediately to tie up some loose ends and then meet up with some partners about founding a retreat center in Hawaii! (Which you’d be welcome to, kitty lover, should we coparent!) 


Please email me at 
blossominghearts@protonmail.com
 if you are interested, and I’ll call you. Or reach out to Cody with a DM or my number. 


Thank you so much, lovelies!

https://m-audio.com/products/view/sp-2


This is a no-frills midi entry workhorse! Semi-weighted velocity sensitive keys, extended octave range, and smooth pitch and mod wheels make this a pleasure to use. The pedal offers realistic resistance and is plug and play. The keyboard was purchased in 2018 and has not had a single problem since; though, there is now some wear on the finish of the keys (see images). I'm selling as I'm moving to the east coast by air/suitcase, and this is impractical to ship due to its size.


Please note: this is midi only and has no internal sounds. You will need a virtual instrument if you plan to use this as a regular piano.

"Razer Core X Gaming Box (eGPU) + NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 Graphics Card - $295
         @stanford.edu","The Razer Core X is an external enclosure for your graphics card (eGPU) that boosts gaming experience by enhancing graphical performance. The good thing about this external GPU is that you can just plug it in and not worry about a more complicated setup to achieve enhanced graphical performance, in case inserting an actual video card into your laptop or another system is not possible.


The device is used but fully-functional. Cosmetically, it is in very good condition with some minor signs of wear that only really show at specific angles under light.


It includes a Thunderbolt 3 cable and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 graphics card. I replaced the thermal paste on the graphics card last month, so it runs much cooler than a normal used graphics card.


More information can be found at Razer's website:

It is sturdy and has been used daily since purchase without issue. People up to 200lbs have slept on the top bunk. Per the description, both bottom and top bunks can support up to 400lbs each.


The bottom bunk can be a full or a twin. You can also use the shelf.


I had spent ~$455 when purchasing this brand-new. Selling for $150. It is fully disassembled with all screws in a Ziploc bag. it is ready for pickup!

"60"" 4k UHD SMASUNG Smart TV - $350
         @stanford.edu","Hi!


I would like to get rid of my 4k UHD TV.


About the TV:

It is a Direct LED TV from 2017 with 4k UHD resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR support (does not seem to be compatible with some ps5 games, if used for gaming). Perfect for streaming!


You can look up the specs in more detail here: 
https://www.samsclub.com/p/60-uhd-smart-tv-120hz-3-hdmi-wifi/prod20321985


Condition:

The tv is in excellent condition, besides a minor scratch at the bottom left corner. I already bought it with this scratch from Samsung and can honestly say that I could never even tell while watching or gaming on it. You can only see it when the tv is switched off and you know exactly where to look from a close distance.

I've skied on these for years but just got new skis and no longer need them. They are well worn (some scratches on top and bottom) and need new bindings, but the skis themselves are great and have life left in them. If you get new bindings for them and decide to upgrade the skis, you can easily transfer the bindings to the new pair.


This is a perfect pair for someone looking for cheap skis but good quality skis. They are great West Coast all mountain skis - can hold an edge on groomed terrain and are playful and flexible in ungroomed terrain. They even work well in powder. I thoroughly enjoyed them for many years!

         @stanford.edu","Super light, beautiful new Specialized Allez E5 in a stunning raspberry gloss finish. 

Comes with full set of papers, receipt etc. 

This is one of the best reviewed road bikes produced by Specialized. Usually always out of stock. I bought it for indoor training but prefer the gym :) 


- Original papers, receipt

- New 

- super light and extremely fast. 

- 49 frame size 

- Shimano gears 

- PERFECT for Bay Area commuting.


Pick up from Mountain View please. 

Im moving so if you can pick up this weekend I will knock off another $50. 

Thanks! 


With a full FACT carbon fiber fork, the Allez is better handling, smoother riding, and lower in weight—floating over rough chip-seal and carving through corners like a slalom skier.


For the geometry, we developed the Allez by utilizing our vast Retül fit database. This meant creating a geometry that's sure to cover a broad range of positions, while still providing the performance-minded handling you'd expect from your first bike.


Not only does a lightweight bike feel better when you're climbing up a hill, but it's also essential when you're carrying your bike up to the 5th floor, and this was at the forefront of the frame design. With a redesigned E5 Alloy frame, the Allez features a class-leading weight. 


Aggressively thin-walled, yet tough, tubes have been implemented to save weight and this results in over a 450g (1-pound) reduction in the frame and fork alone when compared to some models of yesteryear.

This Allez also features integrated rack and fender mounts, allowing you to get weight of your backpack off you and onto a lightweight rack. This not only makes for a good road bike, but it also enables you to transform it into a fast commuter.",$950,"Sat, Mar 04, 2023 12:25 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129967192

"Razer Core X eGPU + NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 Graphics Card - $350
         @stanford.edu","The Razer Core X is an external enclosure for your graphics card (eGPU) that boosts gaming experience by enhancing graphical performance. The good thing about this external GPU is that you can just plug it in and not worry about a more complicated setup to achieve enhanced graphical performance, in case inserting an actual video card into your laptop or another system is not possible.


The device is used but fully-functional. Cosmetically, it is in very good condition with some minor signs of wear that only really show at specific angles under light.


It includes a Thunderbolt 3 cable and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 graphics card. I replaced the thermal paste on the graphics card last month, so it runs much cooler than a normal used graphics card.

I would like to get rid of my 4k UHD TV.


About the TV:

It is a Direct LED TV from 2017 with 4k UHD resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR support (does not seem to be compatible with some ps5 games, if used for gaming). Perfect for streaming!


You can look up the specs in more detail here: 
https://www.samsclub.com/p/60-uhd-smart-tv-120hz-3-hdmi-wifi/prod20321985


Condition:

The tv is in excellent condition, besides a minor scratch at the bottom left corner. I already bought it with this scratch from Samsung and can honestly say that I could never even tell while watching or gaming on it. You can only see it when the tv is switched off and you know exactly where to look from a close distance.

"60"" 4k UHD SMASUNG Smart TV - $300
         @stanford.edu","Hi!


I would like to get rid of my 4k UHD TV.


About the TV:

It is a Direct LED TV from 2017 with 4k UHD resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR support (does not seem to be compatible with some ps5 games, if used for gaming). Perfect for streaming!


You can look up the specs in more detail here: 
https://www.samsclub.com/p/60-uhd-smart-tv-120hz-3-hdmi-wifi/prod20321985


Condition:

The tv is in excellent condition, besides a minor scratch at the bottom left corner. I already bought it with this scratch from Samsung and can honestly say that I could never even tell while watching or gaming on it. You can only see it when the tv is switched off and you know exactly where to look from a close distance.

The basket mounts to standard MIK interface on your bike rack, and the top cage fits securely and does not let jumping out. When your mutt is not around, the basket is handy as shopping cart. Made by a premium german brand Basil, the combo of basket and cage goes for $151 + $39 plus tax. Our doggo grew out of this setup so our loss is your gain  and we are happy to part with it for mere $140. In case you don't have a rack or MIK plate installed, Summit Bicycles at CalAv carries them and will help you out. Cheers, Stefi.

"Lenovo X1 Carbon 6th Gen - $500
         @stanford.edu","I am selling my Lenovo X1 Carbon (6th generation). It has operated as my personal day-to-day laptop. It is fully functional. Cosmetically, it is in pretty good condition. It does have some signs of wear normal with regular use, but nothing significant. The display is in mint condition. Please see photos in Google Drive for more details.


Photos: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fJPvZcw1pa1brwXoTrM5MzD0UZNQpJOK?usp=sharing


Highlights include:

- i7-8650U (4 cores, 8 threads)

- 16GB DDR3 RAM

- 1TB SSD NVMe

- 14"" 1440P glossy display (2560 x 1440) with Dolby Vision

- 2.4 pounds! Super lightweight


I have done 2 upgrades since I bought this laptop:

1. I upgraded the LCD. It originally came with a 1080P screen. I upgraded it to 1440P. The display is super bright and very vivid with Dolby Vision.

2. I upgraded the speakers. They sound much better than what you would find in a standard X1 Carbon 6th gen. Audio is still the weak point of this laptop, but at least it's not useless anymore.


I love this laptop, but I am selling it because I want to buy an iPad Pro 11.


Includes a USB-C charger brick and cable.


$500. Cash, Zelle, Meta Pay, Apple Pay accepted. I can meet at SLAC campus, Stanford campus, or anywhere in Stanford.


P.S. You will see photos of macOS and Ubuntu Linux loaded on this laptop. This laptop is capable of running these operating systems, and my current setup allows me to boot into any of these operating systems! I plan to erase the drive on the computer and install Windows only prior to sale. However, if you want to keep this configuration, or want to learn how to do it, we can discuss it more over email.",$500,"Sun, Feb 12, 2023 08:01 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129966423

2000030934 Highline 4-Person Dome Tent, 9 x 7' 

Set up camp in a compact yet spacious tent with the Coleman highline 4-person dome tent, 9 x 7. If it rains, this tent keeps you dry thanks to weathertec technology, which uses a tub-like floor with patented corner welds, protected seams, and a covered zipper to help keep water out. Meanwhile, the compact dome shape and a strong frame is tested to withstand 35+ MPH winds. You'll get even more weather protection from a door awning and an included rainfly. Setup is simple with snag-free, continuous pole sleeves, a patented pin-and-ring system, and snag-free insta-clip suspension. INSIDE, there's enough room to stretch out on a queen-size airbed, and storage pockets help to keep small items organized and off the floor. When it's time to head home, the tent easily packs up into an expandable carry bag with a rip Strip for extra storage until you're off on your next adventure.",$30,"Mon, Jan 16, 2023 06:24 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129965482

         @stanford.edu","Calvin Klein Sheer Beauty, eau de toilette, 1.6oz

Brand new (bought 1.5 months ago, still in wrapper, stored in a cool dark place). Got it as a gift, heard wonderful things but I recently got another perfume and don't want this one to go stale.

3.3oz size on discount reselling websites (where quality and exposure is unknown) for $30-$35, so this is similarly discounted while being essentially brand new.


Pick up near Rains or on main campus (Tressider, Green, quad, eng quad).


Description from designer: 


Sheer Beauty by Calvin Klein is a Floral Fruity fragrance for women. Sheer Beauty was launched in 2012. Top notes are Bellini, Bergamot and Red Berries; middle notes are Peony, Jasmine and Pink Lily; base notes are Musk, Sandalwood and Vanille.


The original evokes timeless beauty and elegance, while the new edition turns to young women and emphasizes naturalness, self-confidence and charm.

The composition is floral – fruity, opening with notes of bergamot, red berries and peach Bellini. The perfume’s core includes flowers of peony, pink lily and jasmine. The base is velvety due to accords of sandalwood, musk and vanilla blossom.


The bottle is designed as its predecessor, refreshed with pearly shades of blush color. The face of the fragrance is model Daphne Groeneveld.",$15,"Mon, Jan 16, 2023 11:30 AM",https://supost.com/post/index/129965460

         @stanford.edu","I am downsizing my backpacking gear. As someone who used to be a backpacking guide for several years, I can say this is the best pack for this size range. You can't go wrong with an Osprey pack.


This is a green medium sized Atmos 65L mens pack from a few years ago. I am a woman though and it has been extremely comfortable for me. I have taken extremely good care of this pack, being very careful with it on trips and gently cleaning it after every trip. As such, it is in excellent condition. The close up photos show basically the only visible wear on the pack, just a few scratches on the top and bottom. There's even almost no evidence of dirt on the pack. It does not smell.


I am selling this pack as a package with its Osprey rain cover and REI travel duffel. You must buy all three items. The rain cover has only been used twice and the travel duffel has been used only once. Both are in new/like new condition.


I am selling everything together for $275. This is an absolute steal given the condition of these items, with the full price being $405 -- backpack ($325), rain cover ($40), and travel duffel ($40).


More info on can be found in these links:

I enjoyed all the yoga, dance, cardio, and strength classes and it was super convenient to workout at home with this mirror.

Two lovely travel size bottles I bought in the UK. I am a fan of this brand and kept many for collection. Now I work in a clinical environment where perfumes are not allowed, so I decided to sell some of those. 


Note descriptions from the official site:

""L'Artisan Parfumeur Un Air de Betragne is a woody eau de parfum for man and woman. A fresh and salty marine agreement, inspired by the torrential waves of Brittany. With this fragrance, the Nose wants to recall a light breeze that caresses the body, the salt taste on the lips and skin after a stormy day."" (

"Cybot robot platform - $30
         @stanford.edu","This cybot robot base is perfect for building your own robot, controlled by an arduino, raspberry pi or RC transmitter. It looks like a lady bug and is adorable :) I have two of them and built the second one, but not this one, so I would love for someone else to get some good use out of it. This one is virtually brand new, never used. The soft translucent rubber patches open to give access to the inside, where you can put the electronics and the battery. The shell has many holes for sensors and LEDs. Under it, two powerful DC motors with gearboxes make it able to go up steep slopes, and case holder/latch for a 9V battery and 4 AA batteries. The wheels are high quality rubber for grip and durability.

"*NEW* Gotrax Gpro 3 wheel electric scooter, lock, and helmet - $700
         @stanford.edu","I'm selling a Gotrax Gpro 3 wheel electric scooter. These retail new on Amazon for $899, and I'm asking $700 for the scooter, helmet, and lock -- everything you need to hit the ground rolling (or $600 for the scooter alone). I bought this scooter due to my balance issues, but due to the narrow width between the back tires, it just doesn't work for me. I can't even balance on it standing still, let alone moving. Adding to the frustration of not being able to ride it, this was delivered by UPS yesterday and the box was destroyed, ensuring I cannot return it for a refund. 


I'm in College Terrace and know this would be a great little scooter for getting around campus and the surrounding area (think TJ's, University Ave, or California Ave). I'd love to see it find a new home! Serious inquiries only -- Please text 573-746-6300 


Thank you!

This time she has a samlpe to see how it'd go and she's selling for as low as $3 for any pair of earings and $5 for any necklace. The prices are currently this low because she didn't have to pay costums and she's not looking to make profit but rather see how it would work out here!

The necklaces are packaged as well.

"1972 Ford Mustang Mach 1 Convertible, Professionally Restored - $28,000
         @stanford.edu","1972 Ford Mustang Mach 1 Convertible, Professionally & Completely Restored, Garage Kept


Professionally and fully restored by Paul Czecholinski at JC Classics in 2012. The car was completely restored from the ground up. More than $100,000 was put into this car. She has a beautiful throaty sounds and runs like a champ. Come see for yourself. This beauty has been covered and pampered ever since.


Engine: 1989 302 H.O V8 (5.0 L)

Exterior: Yellow with burgundy trim

Interior: Black with burgundy trim

Transmission: Automatic

Convertible Top: Automatic


Condition:


This car is in excellent condition for its age. It was completely and professionally restored by Paul Czecholinski at JC Classics in 2012, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Paul was meticulous to ensure the details are correct, and it shows under the hood and inside and out. After 10 years, there are a few (not many) scratches on the paint, and some wearing of the lap belts on the side of the leather seats. Because the trunk was lined with Rhino Liner, it is in mint condition.


Maintenance History:


I haven’t had any major issues with this car in the 10 years I have owned it.


• Regular oil changes.

• 2 new rear tires in 2021

• New distributor in 2022


Modifications:


• There are several modifications, I will highlight a few here.

• Vintage-looking modern stereo. This stereo comes with an Aux cable to connect your smart phone

• A custom engraving “Halfway to Hell” on either side of the vehicle, professionally made by . This is removable, but it looks gorgeous.

• Custom Mustang racing steering wheel

• Custom paint job

• Trunk sealed with Rhino Lining


Known issue: Once per summer, the temperature warning light comes on. I pull over, wait for the engine coolant to go from the coolant overflow reservoir back into the engine (takes 5–10 minutes), and then top off the coolant. Then she’s good to go again. I don’t have any more overheating issues for the rest of the day (or the rest of the month, for that matter).","$28,000","Wed, Sep 28, 2022 07:49 AM",https://supost.com/post/index/129961359

"6-Panel SOLID WOOD Room Divider (""shoji screen"" style) - $125
         @stanford.edu","Please come prevent grievous feline injury while freshening up your Zoom background with this amazing room divider! 


I bought this freestanding white paulownia wood room divider to use in my bedroom/home office on Amazon two weeks ago and paid $165 for it. It is absolutely stunning and I love it, but my cat has other plans. He is on a mission to jump over it, climb on top of it, or run full-speed head first into it. I give us less than a week before he has knocked it over and caused injury to himself, me, or both of us (remember, this is solid wood). I need to switch to a room dividing curtain ASAP, but my loss is your gain!


The divider is large (over 5' tall) but not terribly heavy, as I carried it up a flight of stairs myself. I wish I could deliver it, but it is larger than my Smart Car, so pickup only. 


I'm asking $125 for the divider -- not what I spent for it, but enough to replace it with a very long curtain rod and curtains. I can take Zelle or Venmo for payment, and I am just off campus in College Terrace.

some models i test rode recently and really liked include 


Trek Domane, Checkpoint

Specialized Diverge

i'm located about a 45min drive south of campus until i move in mid-September, so if you're in the area and are ok with it, i would love to take your bike out for a test ride!

"Cloth Diapers - A Great Starter Set! - $5
         @stanford.edu","Interested in cloth diapering?  

But not sure where to start?

This is a great starter set to get you going.

There are 11 Mama Koala diaper covers included here.

Usually these retail for $8/diaper.

I'm selling them for $5/diaper.  

Or if you buy a set (there's the Color set on top, the Ocean set in the middle, and the Book set at the bottom), I'll take a dollar off each diaper.  

So if you buy all 4 Color, or all 4 Books, it would be $16 for each set - that's 4 diapers for the price of 2!  

The 3 Ocean diapers would be $12 - that's 3 diapers for the price of 1.5!

I'm also happy to talk with you about cloth diapering, and answer your questions so you can get started with confidence.

Good luck of your diapering journey!

www.tenways.com
, the model is the CGO600)

I bought it in April this year for my commute from Mountain View to campus and it made the longer way such a nice ride I was looking forward to every time.

The bike comes with lights, but without a lock. It it fully functional and still quite new. The original price was 1799$, and I would ask for 1100$, but feel free to offer me a price!


You can read about the technical details on the website, here is just a summary of the most important specs:

- single gear, simple architecture, yet highly efficient and comfortable to ride without motor assistance

- motor support to up to 20mph / 32kmh

- Carbon belt drive, no worries about slipping chains

- hydraulic disc brakes

- pretty light weight for an e-bike (15kg), absolutely no problem getting it up stairs / on trains etc


I used the assistance only for longer ways or hills (riding this bike in SF in actually fun! ;) ) and enjoyed the normal bike riding just as much.


Let me know if you are interested in a test ride and feel free to ask any questions!

Assembly took quite a bit of time, so I will be leaving this assembled. It’s incredibly lightweight so 2 people could easily carry to another unit at Stanford or put in the back of a truck for transport.

         @stanford.edu","Hey friends! The tutoring company my friend works for is hiring tutors for $60/hour for in-person tutoring and $40/hour for virtual tutoring (no commute, just log on/log off). They’ve been amazing to work for, so we thought we’d spread the word!


Currently, they’re looking for tutors and mentors for high school math, science, writing, or CS 1-on-1 tutoring. Scheduling is super flexible (you pick pretty much whenever you want to work during the week) and how many students you’d like to teach as well.  If you’re passionate about teaching and are interested, feel free to get more info at the link here:

Posting on behalf of a dear friend Sue-Jean


""Selling my beloved silver Subaru Forester 2017 – It is in excellent condition!

I bought it new in 2017 and since then, it has been in no accidents, there are no damages, I've gotten it serviced regularly, and I replaced the brakes and tires both within the last few months and year, respectively. It's currently at about 84,000 miles and runs at 27-28mpg these days. As far as some features go, it has heated seating, a backup camera, and roof racks.


I'm more than happy to provide a VIN number or additional details/photos/answer other questions you may have. I'm asking for $22k or best offer (a steal these days, am I right) and am based in San Francisco, California.

"Norco 2021 Storm 3 - $450
         @stanford.edu","The Norco 2021 Storm 3 is a Cross Country Mountain Bike, it comes in size S, green color, 9 speeds, Wheel size 27.5“. 


Purchased 1.5 years ago, Retail: 899$. 

Very good condition because: 

- Only used within the city to go on a rid with our daughter, who was sitting in her bike trailer

- This bike was stored in our garage since we purchased it. 

Some details listed below (for more details please look up bike model online): 


The Storm picks up where road, gravel, and hybrid bikes can't go – fatter tires, off-road-oriented progressive design, and features that'll give riders the chance to truly experience what mountain biking is truly all about in a bike that won't break the bank.


The Storm offers quality, performance and accessibility to a wide array of riders, and is the perfect chance to give you the time and versatility to learn what kind of mountain biking is perfect for you!


- 6061 Alloy Frame with smooth welds and updated geometry

- 100mm Travel Suspension Fork

- Internal routing for shifter and brake cables

- Increased 2.35"" tire fitment

- 27.5"" and 29"" frame options depending on size

- Shimano Alivio 2x9 Drivetrain w/11-36T Cassette

- Maxxis Rekon 2.35"" Tires


RIDER BENEFITS:

- PROGRESSIVE DESIGN: The Storm uses Norco's holistic approach to fit and geometry to achieve its nimble, confident trail performance. The unique combination of longer reach, slacker head tube angle and steep seat tube angle provides a more forward weight distribution within a longer wheelbase. This allows more powerful, efficient pedaling, increased climbing traction and added grip and control when descending to help make the most of every ride.

- 100MM TRAVEL SUSPENSION FORKS: Each Storm features 100mm of front suspension travel – the perfect amount for off-road adventure and exploration, without feeling like you're carrying around extra weight or bulk when you don't need it.

- INTERNAL ROUTING FOR SHIFTER AND BRAKE CABLES: By routing the brake and shift cables inside the frames, they are out of harm's way and away from the elements. That means shifting and braking performance last longer between services, and the bikes look clean!

- 2.35"" TIRE CLEARANCE: The Storm series comes equipped with 2.25"" tires for a smooth, all-round fast ride, but the frame is designed to take up to 2.35"" rubber, so if your adventures start to get a little looser, just throw on some wider tires, and the Storm is good to go!

- TWO WHEEL SIZES, ONE BIKE: Depending on what frame size you ride, the Storm is available in a wheel size to suit you. The XS, and S are equipped with 27.5"" tires to help fit smaller riders, and the L and XL feature 29"" wheels so taller riders can take advantage of their smooth ride. If you're ride a medium, you're in luck! You get to choose either wheel size depending on your preference!

"Vintage Steelcase desk - Free
         @stanford.edu","My beautiful vintage Steelcase desk won't fit in our new apartment. It's yours for a steal if you come pick it up in the next week!


This desk is classic Midcentury Modern/industrial chic. Its massive wood veneer top has plenty of space for a lamp, monitor and printer (or two monitors), plus drawers for office supplies and a small built-in filing cabinet.


Online dealers sell this series of Steelcase desk for more than $1,200: 
https://retrooffice.com/collections/vintage-brushed-steel-collection


Please note again that the desk is very solidly built and heavy, so you will need a truck and a strong helper or two. (I'm recovering from knee surgery, so I can only provide moral support — doctor's orders.) The drawers are removable to lighten the load and it fits in our elevator, so you don't need to worry about stairs!


Dimensions: 60""l x 30""w x 29""h.


It has a couple scuffs and a dent on the right side that's hard to photograph because of current placement — but impossible to tell if you put it in a nook or against a wall.",Free,"Thu, Jul 21, 2022 08:01 AM",https://supost.com/post/index/129956721

Sometimes the simplest things are the best things, and Charge’s Cooker 1 is one of those things. The lightweight aluminum frame and fork team up to rail corners with precise stiffness and efficiently send your power to the trail via a streamlined, 1 x 10-speed Shimano-guided drivetrain. A pair of husky, 27.5 x 2.8 WTB tires are wrapped around 40mm-wide rims for supreme traction and excellent maneuverability, so you can carve tricky curves and thread the needle between the boulders. The hydraulic disc brakes deliver relentless stopping power in all conditions at the slightest squeeze of your finger.


The all-new Cooker adventure range is designed around 27Plus wheels; 27Plus takes the best attributes of current wheel sizes, blending performance and speed of 29"", the simple esthetics of the traditional 26"" and cushioning of a fat bike tire into one size hat looks perfectly in proportion and is fit for purpose all with unparalleled grip on any terrain.

         @stanford.edu","My beautiful (but massive) vintage Steelcase desk won't fit in our new apartment. It's yours for a steal if you come pick it up in the next couple weeks!


This is classic MCM/industrial chic. Its massive faux wood top has plenty of space for a lamp, monitor and printer (or two monitors), plus drawers for office supplies and a small built-in filing cabinet.


Similar pieces go for $400 or more on eBay: 
https://www.ebay.com/itm/143894601167?hash=item2180c95dcf:g:AOoAAOSw~Vhf4iHl


Please note that like all vintage Steelcases, this desk is very solidly built and heavy, so you will need a truck and a strong helper or two. (I'm recovering from knee surgery, so I can only provide moral support — doctor's orders.) The drawers are removable to lighten the load and it fits in our elevator, so you don't need to worry about stairs!


Dimensions: 60""l x 30""w x 29""h.


It has a dent on the right side that's hard to photograph because of current placement, but impossible to tell if you put it in a nook or against a wall.",$300,"Thu, Jul 07, 2022 01:06 PM",https://supost.com/post/index/129955853
