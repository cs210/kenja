Angelique:The Marquise of Angels is the first book of this series, and is about the childhood and first marriage of one of literatures greatest heroines, Angelique. The copy I read was actually an old library copy of it, and it was titled Angelique and combined this book and Road to Versailles as one. The Angelique books are excellent historical fiction and both Golons(Anne and Serge) were born storytellers. The Marquise of Angels is my favorite book of the series so far. Its really brought to life a time period I knew very little about, 1600s France. This book has everything. Intrigue,suspense,romance,action,wonderful historical detail,great and memorable characters, the works. I also love how Golon brings to life historical figures. Theres so many memorable scenes in just this one book, my favorite scene is probably Angelique and the poison(I won't give it away!) Like another reviewer has said, it is definitly a very cool scene. I just can't understand why these books are out of print, they are quality fiction! Theres 63 reviews for this book on Amazon, alot of books that are in print don't get that many! And all of them are positive five star reviews too! I know they did put the first 2 books in print again a few years ago, as special large print editions but alot of people(myself included) don't like large print. If only they would put the whole series out again(regular print) and get the last three books translated, I'd be a happy camper...",9fbe15ea-d49f-3337-92ea-5079c26bb8a3,1631,54

My poor elder sister had to wait her turn after either of us were through. My father and I liked the series so much, we made sure we gave each other Angelique books as birthday dan x-mas presents. I'm Indonesian, and in the late 60s and early 70s imported books were hard to come by. Our family used to buy up indiscriminately any book we found in English. As it is, it's only after I opened Amazon.com that I've found out there were more than nine Angelique books in all. I've read the first seven over and over again, but have never seen ""The Jesuit Trap"" nor ""Gold Beard's Downfall"". ""The Marquise of the Angels"" is positively my most favourite book in all my reading life. Unfortunately, somebody borrowed my copy many, many years ago, and I've never found a replacement. I wrote to Pan Books, I rummage through second-hand book carts wherever I find them, all to no avail. The Angelique character, to my mind, is a proto-feminist. She never yielded to feminine stereotyping, and always did her 'own thing', regardless of society's disapproval. I do believe that her character made a huge impact on myself. The other outstanding book in the series is ""Angelique and the Sultan"" in which there are great passages comparing Islamic and western philosophy. In this age of misunderstanding in the west about Islam, I think reprinting this one particular book would be an enormous contribution to the discussion. There are other passages in ""Angelique in Love"" quoted by Joffrey de Peyrac which shows diligent research by Serge and Anne Golon on comparative religion, albeit still stilted towards western Christian argument. Nevertheless, seldom since have I come across such a good read which provides me with instant philosophical discourse and a crash course in French history all at the same time. I'm excited to discover that others have found the series as captivating for them as they were for me. I agree that a publisher would do well to have the series reprinted.",5cfb46d5-fc12-3b47-8ab7-1387482844aa,2076,26

Her spiritual growth during the span of the story is sublime, the historical background is fascinating, the scientific and philosophical details are brilliant and meticulously researched.

The culture of sugar, more specifically the contemporary Caribbean sugarcane industry, is really one I would risk saying not many people from the comfort of their protected circumstance here in the States know very much about. This story presents it all in a totally shocking manner, at times brutally so. The author Cambeira skillfully paints what seemed to me to a portrait of Caribbean reality: all the characters, the vivid descriptions, the suspense and tension of the action that continues to build, the dialogue that was cleverly presented in a simultaneous bilingual fashions, the notions of global economics, the social history and politics ... it's all there.Perhaps most impressive to me personally was the way Cambeira captured the real voices of oppressed and exploited women who work under these modern-day slave conditions. Quite frankly, I have never read anything like this before. I feel there's a movie waiting to be made. I for one am certainly not going to wait to read the strenuous efforts on the part of critics to discover, dissect and digest the text's central significance.

Azucar?s story is a complex and hauntingly atmospheric tale of sustained intrigue, murder, revenge, forbidden love, and an unnerving journey into the mystical spirit world of Caribbean ritual. Even after Azucar?s fiercely determined grandmother arranges for her to emigrate to Canada -- with a most unlikely couple-- where she is dramatically transformed, she is still not completely free from the hypnotic pull of the distant Caribbean plantation.

Some characters like Harold and Marcelo offer serious pronouncements, quite in context, against the evils of globalization and the down side of world economics. The author here is also on target when he presents the frequently misunderstood and misrepresented Hollywood versions of African-derived belief systems in the Caribbean, as well as the various rituals and practices that are normally maligned by some &quot;outsiders.&quot; Cambeira proves that he is an &quot;insider&quot; and really knows how to tell a story.

Betty Crocker's Cooky Book was originally printed in 1963. Yes, it's cooky, not today's cookie.The 2002 reprint includes only two short paragraphs of introduction on the title page. The new paragraphs provide warnings about today's ingredients and food safety concerns. They encourage you to ask your mother or grandmother how to make them if you don't understand the ingredients or the recipes. What a great way to share a family heritage, by baking cookies together!The cookbook is divided into 6 sections: Cooky Primer, Holiday Cookies, Family Favorites, Quick `N Easy Cookies, Company Best Cookies, and Betty Crocker's Best Cookies. The Cooky Primer section includes instructions on how to ""measure flour by dipping,"" Necessary Utensils (including a ""rotary egg beater""), Baking Hints, and a Q&amp;A section which covers self-rising flour, correcting cooky dough, and how to prevent soft cooky dough.The Cooky Primer section includes a color picture at the bottom of each page, showing the finished cookies and brownies. On page 11 of the Cooky Primer is a recipe for Butterscotch Brownies. This recipe is my husband's favorite. All the recipe calls for is butter, brown sugar, an egg, flour, baking powder, salt, vanilla, and walnuts. This brownie recipe spells out the secret to baking perfect brownies: ""Do not overbake!"". My Uncle Glen is a commercial chef, and he taught me that little gem at the precocious age of 10. These brownies have a wonderful butterscotch flavor, and come out of the oven chewy and golden brown.In the Heritage Cookies section, I baked the Old-Fashioned Sour Cream cookies on page 79. This recipe is a little more complex, it calls for shortening, sugar, an egg, vanilla, flour, baking powder, soda (that's baking soda, not tonic), salt, nutmeg, and ""commercial sour cream."" These little cookies retain their shape beautifully, without using parchment paper! Their delicate texture is accented with a touch of nutmeg, making them a wonder for lovers of spice cakes. One batch made 53 individual cookies.The authors truly saved the best for last with this cookbook. The final section, Betty Crocker's Best Cookies, features favorite cookie recipes over time. Betty Crocker's time begins with Hermits from 1880! Starting with 1880, the cookie recipes move in 10-year increments. For example, 1890-1900 Cinnamon Jumbles. 1920-1930 Brownies. 1930-1935 Molasses Crinkles. These heritage recipes are accented by historical highlights and humorous anecdotes such as ""the first brownies were a fallen chocolate cake."" This section is made for cookbook lovers of all ages. If you ever wondered what children ate for cookies in 1900 when they got home from school, you'll find your answer here. Cinnamon Jumbles!",6afe588b-18b9-3992-8146-d782b0176c77,2877,11

Using shortening does in fact serve a purpose without being a flavorful component, and is therefor not a shortcoming of the cookie collection (in my grandmother's day, she used lard).

R. Bird ""Ramseelbird""",19/20,5.0,1086048000,Don't pat the wombat!,"Until I read this book I had never seen a dedication in a picture book in which the illustrator thanked the author. Yet lo and behold, at the beginning of ""Diary of a Wombat"" read the words, ""Thanks for letting me play, Jackie. This was fun"", signed by illustrator Bruce Whatley. He's not wrong either. The book is a heaping helpful of fun, starring a cuddly adorable little wombat and her low key adventures. Having been published at the same time as the similarly titled (and, in my humble opinion, less impressive) book, ""Diary of a Worm"", ""Diary of a Wombat"" never really received the praise and adoration it so rightly deserved. To me, this book is the perfect balance of cute and sly (a difficult mixture indeed).We follow our heroine, a rolly-polly little unnamed wombat as she goes about her days. For a wombat, life doesn't consist of much more than sleeping, munching on some grass, and sleeping again. The first few days we spend with the wombat proceed at about this pace. All that changes when the wombat acquires some new human neighbors. A family of wide-eyed Australians first meet the little creature when she decided to use their picnic area as her own personal dustbath. Please note the shocked lovebirds perched on a nearby birdbath. As the days go by the wombat slowly but surely teaches her humans to feed her carrots as well as oats. By the end, she comes to the undeniable conclusion that, ""humans are easily trained and make quite good pets"".I can't imagine a single objection that could be successfully lobbied against this tale. Let us consider, first of all, the wombat herself. Think of a teddy bear with a slightly larger nose and I think you'll have a rough idea of what I'm describing here. The wombat is incapable, it seems, of anger or malicious intent. All the damage she does comes from a self-absorbed sense of what is best for herself. Wet laundry in the way? Get rid of it. Humans not feeding you lately? Make a ruckus with their metal garbage can. She is drawn particularly realistically, which of course makes her all the funnier. It is a relief that the humans have not yet taken steps to rid themselves of this particularly intense and likable little pest. Who can resist her half-closed eyes as she chews contentedly on a freshly grown carrot?Not only does Jackie French tell her tale with just the right amount of humor and timing but Bruce Whatley outdoes himself with his whimsical illustrations. Wombats never had it so good. If you're looking for something cute but witty, that treads between the humorous and the tragic with fantastic results (not to mention being more than a little kid-friendly), then I present for your reading enjoyment, and the enjoyment of your peers/children, ""Diary of a Wombat"".",92816e68-4600-3d27-8289-14e21af28e69,2754,19

And not just when I was knee high to a grasshopper, either; I still read them. I have, for example, an inordinate fondness for badgers, and read all sorts of books about them, including kids' books. The same, for reasons that would take far too long to relate, holds true for wombats, so Jackie French's Diary of a Wombat was a no-brainer. In general, I look at recent kids' books (and, were I to admit the truth to myself, probably a large number of those I read as a kid) and wonder why adult writers didn't figure out as kids that subtle humor really does work on the younger set. Thankfully, some writers either figured it out or are just naturally more subtle than others. Praise Jackie French to the highest skies for bringing together wombats and really, really good humor in one volume.I haven't laughed out loud while reading a kids' book in months, if not years. I can't remember doing so more than once at any kids' book I've read in the past decade, and it's rare when I read adult novels, too. Diary of a Wombat, once it gets rolling (you'll notice it starts off slow; the kids won't), had me in stitches. French plays every joke as if the wombat is his own straight man (he is, of course, being a wombat), and it works marvelously. You don't have an anthropomorphized character here; the wombat is a wombat, pure and simple. (Except he seems to know how to write well enough to keep a diary.) It's his simple reactions to the obstacles in his way that make this such a fun read; it's worlds away from those old Warner Brothers cartoons where Wile E. Coyote devises Rube Goldberg-esque plans to get around his obstacles, and all the funnier for that.Wonderful. Your kids need a copy of this.

And since they keep getting better and better I am guessing the fifth and last book to be more amazing! Lynn Austin does a wonderful job depciting the terror of Mannaseh's reign. He is simply insecure and believes everyone is plotting aganist him. Instead of turning to Yahweh he starts turning to the stars, mediums, etc. for answers. He even begins promoting orgies for worship and sets up Asherah poles and places for women to ""offer"" themselves to the idol goddess. I have never shed a tear in the first 3 books of this series but the beginning of the book when Eliakim and Isaiah were being falsely accussed and then executed drew a tear from me. It's amazing to see how even when confined to the darkness of a prison and facing death the next morning, these two men trusted God to the very end. I also found it exciting to read about Joshua's plans and such for smuggling himself and his family out of the country. Especially near the end he decides to smuggle the ark of the covenant and Mannasseh's brother--Prince Amariah to Eqypt.With a host of new characters and some old ones as well this is definatly worth the read. I'm looking forward to reading ""Among the Gods"" and hope Lynn Austin decides to write more biblical fiction in the future. :-)",bac183cd-e366-3d2d-a877-b94c3a0d0d6c,2297,17

And after book #4, ""Faith of My Fathers,"" I'm still highly impressed. Taking the story of Manasseh, Lynn Austin seemingly took it, and split it into two parts. And she was quite clever with the delivery. Some might assume that this came to an abrupt ending, leaving the reader clueless. If you know your Bible, there's nothing clueless about it. This is what I'd call the II Kings version of the story. Yet in The Bible, Manasseh's story continues in II Chronicles. And it worked that way with a lot of the kings. In a lot of cases, most of the kings we read about in The Bible concerning The Northern and Southern Kingdoms were split into two different sections, II Kings, and II Chronicles. From Jehoshaphat, to Joash, to Amaziah, to Jotham, to Hezekiah, to Manasseh! ALL THESE KINGS and more were split up into the two sections. Ok, there's the Bible history lesson! What about this story? Read on!Ahaz, Manasseh's great-grandfather, was one of the most worthless kings in all of the history. And Manasseh wasn't too far behind him. He was the son of one of the greatest kings to ever reign, Hezekiah. If you don't know the whole story and read this, you'll wonder if anything good ever came out of Manasseh. Lynn Austin, being the author, and better yet, the voice of reason, gives Manasseh a reason to be bitter, and to do what he did. But Austin gives Manasseh a childhood friend in Joshua, who's as clumsy as an Ox! His nickname is Ox. But something happens. And from nicknames to nonsense, there is a reason that these two former best friends are now bitter enemies. King Manasseh is nothing but a master of disaster, and he raises hell throughout the land! He has people executed, and he destroys what he father put together. Joshua wants nothing more then to get even.If you're wondering if some of the things in this are extreme, they are indeed. What's worse, they really happened. But the good news is that certain people didn't forget the faith their fathers held so dear. I think that's where the title comes from. Because when times get so tough, the question is simple. Are we going to run to God, or run away from God? I'd personally suggest not running away from the great Yahweh! But I think when things get tough, you want to be a rebel just as much as Manasseh. But what do you do? Where do you turn? And for the record, by the time THIS story comes to a close, he still has a chip on his shoulder.But there is one final installment, and it happens to be ""Among The Gods."" I think it should be pretty good. That's probably going to be Lynn Austin's II Chronicles part of this story. I already know the end, but I can't wait to read her novelization of it! She's a great storyteller. So far, I have yet to be disappointed.",b8237f46-947a-33e5-9a88-3dca5891a9ec,2813,4

Figure drawing,4.90625,"Many of us want to learn “how to draw.” But as artist Anthony Ryder explains, it’s much more important to learn what to draw. In other words, to observe and draw what we actually see, rather than what we think we see. When it comes to drawing the human figure, this means letting go of learned ideas and expectation of what the figure should look like. It means carefully observing the interplay of form and light, shape and line, that combine to create the actual appearance of human form. In The Artist’s Complete Guide to Figure Drawing, amateur and experienced artists alike are guided toward this new way of seeing and drawing the figure with a three-step drawing method. The book’s progressive course starts with the block-in, an exercise in seeing and establishing the figure’s shape. It then build to the contour, a refined line drawing that represents the figure’s silhouette. The last step is tonal work on the inside of the contour, when light and shadow are shaped to create the illusion of form. Separate chapters explore topics critical to the method: gesture, which expresses a sense of living energy to the figure; light, which largely determines how we see the model; and form, which conveys the figure’s volume and mass. Examples, step-by-steps, and special “tips” offer helpful hints and practical guidance throughout.

This is a grand text. absolutely dedicated work, you can see the earnestness in Loomis' anxious words about getting across the details to the reader.Kimon's 'Natural Way to Draw' is a classic in a different way, where he asks us to discover almost everything. Loomis gives us the crutches. I think a combination of these two approaches can be terrific. thats what I am finding out.It has been very fullfilling , since I can pick up the artifacts of drawing the figure, and infact drawing anything for that matter, Loomis will lead you to explore and expand, the techniques are amazingly simple, yet absolutely powerful.He reiterates to see the structure beneath anything, the skeleton, and how it aids us in construction.Note: the book is out of print, but several online versions are scattered across the Net.",dd3f485e-e9af-39b4-8073-b413e3d86575,1401,40

Figure drawing,4.90625,"Many of us want to learn “how to draw.” But as artist Anthony Ryder explains, it’s much more important to learn what to draw. In other words, to observe and draw what we actually see, rather than what we think we see. When it comes to drawing the human figure, this means letting go of learned ideas and expectation of what the figure should look like. It means carefully observing the interplay of form and light, shape and line, that combine to create the actual appearance of human form. In The Artist’s Complete Guide to Figure Drawing, amateur and experienced artists alike are guided toward this new way of seeing and drawing the figure with a three-step drawing method. The book’s progressive course starts with the block-in, an exercise in seeing and establishing the figure’s shape. It then build to the contour, a refined line drawing that represents the figure’s silhouette. The last step is tonal work on the inside of the contour, when light and shadow are shaped to create the illusion of form. Separate chapters explore topics critical to the method: gesture, which expresses a sense of living energy to the figure; light, which largely determines how we see the model; and form, which conveys the figure’s volume and mass.

It takes the reader through the journey of Brother Andrew's early life as an 'adrenaline junkie-heavy drinking-reckless Dutch soldier' turned Bible smuggling missionary to the nations of the Iron Curtain.Each chapter is a gripping real life account of Brother Andrew's travels. It's like reading a good suspense novel. Brother Andrew doesn't gloss over his own shortcomings, nor his fears and trepidations about his work. He simply just tells the miracles as they happened, and gives God the complete credit.I won't spoil the story for you but I will say that certain books have come into my life at certain times. I believe it's for a reason: to encourage me, teach me, and strengthen my faith. God's Smuggler is serving as one of those books. There are a few themes that run through the entirety of the book:* The power of faith--The book is so full of miracles...There are countless occasions when Brother Andrew should've been arrested, or killed, or stranded or (you get the picture), but God intervened in a miraculous way.* The power of prayer--Prayer was undoubtedly the fuel for this dangerous work serving God under Communism's oppression. Brother Andrew and his coworkers were prayer warriors.* The power of trust--Brother Andrew didn't, upon sensing God's call to work in the Communist countries, apply to an already established missions organization. He simply trusted God, day by day, to provided for his needs, so long as He was following His call. His trust for provision is incredible, and would probably be considered crazy by today's standards.* The power of sacrifice--Brother Andrew has lived a life most today would deem unlivable. He gave up multiple chances for 'the good life', and forsook even the most basic items that we today take for granted, all so that we could continue the work he felt called to.Faith, prayer, trust, and sacrifice...much needed lessons for me in the 'here and now'.",920fe397-fb58-3ff6-ab46-1555279af5bf,2016,41

There have been times I have read this book and felt the uplift of inspiration. The best thing about the narrative is that its real to life with a transparency that is familiar to anyone who has ever prodded through life wandering about life, God, purpose, and destiny. Let me share from one story in the book. I truly believe there is no other book that has inspired me to be challenged in my faith as this by Brother Andrew.""One night I went out for a long, solitary walk. On several occasions students had warned me not to 'go into Patrick.' Patrick was the slum sitting at the bottom of our hill. It was, they said, the home of addicts, drunks, thieves, even murderers, and walking its streets was unsafe. And yet this area drew me now as if it had something to say.All around me were the dirty gray streets of Patrick. Litter blew across the cobblestones. The September air was already raw. Before I had gone five blocks I was accosted two times by beggars. I gave them all the money I had in my pockets and watched as they moved without pretense toward the nearest pub. I knew that these drifters, begging in the streets of the Glasgow slums, would receive a better income than the missionaries-in-training at the top of the hill.I could not understand why this bothered me so. Was I greedy? I didnt think so. We had always been poor in my family, and I had never worried about it. What was it then?And suddenly, walking back up the hill toward the school, I had my answer.The question was not one of money at all. What I was worried about was a relationship.At the chocolate factory I trusted Mr. Ringers to pay me in full and on time. Surely I said to myself, if an ordinary factory worker could be financially secure, so coud one of God's workers.I turned through the gate of the school. Above me was the reminder 'Have Faith In God.'That was it! It wasn't that I needed the security of a certain amount of money, it was that I needed the security of a relationship.I walked up the crunchy pebblewalk feeling more and more certain that I was on the verge of something exciting. The school was asleep and quiet. I tiptoed upstairs and sat by the bedroom window looking out over Glasgow.*******************************************************If I were going to give my life as a servant of the King, I had to know that King. What was He like? In what WAY could I trust Him? In the same way I trusted a set of impersonal laws? Or could I trust Him as a living leader, as a very present commander in battle? The question was central. Because if He were a King in name only, I would rather go back to the chocolate factory. I would remain a Christian, but I would know that my religion was only a set of principles, excellent to be followed, but hardly demanding devotion.Suppose on the other hand that I were to discover God to be a Person, in the sense that He communicated and cared and loved and led. That was something quite different. That was the kind of King I would follow into any battle.And somehow, sitting there in the moonlight that September night in Glasgow, I knew that my probing into God's nature was gong to begin with this issue of money. That night I knelt in front of the window and made a covenant with Him. 'Lord,' I said, 'I need to know if I can trust You in practical things. I thank You for letting me earn the fees for the first semester. I ask You now to supply the rest of them. If I have to be so much as a day late in paying, I shall know that I am supposed to go back to the chocolate factory.'It was a childish prayer, petulant and demanding. But then I was still a child in the Christian life. The remarkable thing is that God honored my prayer. But not without first testing me in some rather amusing ways.""The story continues in a fascinating exploration of faith in God:""The first semester sped by. Mornings we spent in theclassrooms studying systematic theology, homiletics,world religions, linguistics--the type of coursestaught in any seminary. In the afternoon we worked atpractical skills: bricklaying, plumbing, carpentry,first aid, tropical hygiene, motor repair. For severalweeks all of us, girls as well as boys, worked at theFord factory in London, learning how to take a carapart and put it back together. In addition to thosestandard trades, we were taught to build huts out ofpalm fronds and how to make mud jars that would holdwater.And meanwhile we took turns in the kitchen and thelaundry and the garden. No one was exempt. One of thestudents was a doctor, a German woman, and I used towatch her scouring garbage pails as though she werepreparing a room for surgery.The weeks passed so fast that soon it came time for meto head out on the first of several training trips inevangelism.'You're going to like this, Andy,' said Mr. Dinnen.'It's an exercise in trust. The rules are simple. Eachstudent on your team is given a one-pound banknote.With that you go on a missionary tour throughScotland. You're expected to pay your owntransportation, your own lodging, your food, anyadvertising you want to do, the renting of halls,providing refreshments--''All on a one-pound note?''Worse than that. When you get back to school afterfour weeks, you're expected to pay back the pound!'I laughed. 'Sounds like we'll be passing the hat allthe time.''Oh, you're not allowed to take up collections! Never.You're not to mention money at your meetings. All ofyour needs have got to be provided without anymanipulation on your part--or the experiment is afailure.'I was a member of a team of five boys. Later when Itried to reconstruct where our funds came from duringthose four weeks, it was hard to. It seemed that whatwe needed was always just there. Sometimes a letterwould arrive from one of the boys' parents with alittle money. SOmetimes we would get a check in themail from a church we had visited days or weeksearlier. The notes that came with those gifts werealways interesting. 'I know you don't need money oryou would have mentioned it,' someone would write.'But God just wouldn't let me get to sleep tonightuntil I had put this in an envelope for you.'Contributions frequently came in the form of produce.In one little town in the highlands of Scotland wewere given six hundred eggs. We had eggs forbreakfast, eggs for lunch, eggs as hors d'oeuvresbefore a dinner of eggs with an egg-white meringuedessert. It was weeks before we could look a chickenin the eye.But money or produce, we struck fast to two rules: wenever mentioned a need aloud, and we gave away a titheof whatever came to us as soon as we got it--withintwenty-four hours if possible.Another team that set out from school at the same timewe did, was not so strict about tithing. They setaside their ten percent all right, but they didn'tgive it away immediately, 'in case we run into anemergency.' Of course they had emergencies! So did we,every day. But they ended their month owing money tohotels, lecture halls, and markets all over Scotland,while we came back to school almost ten pounds ahead.Fast as we could give money away, God was alwaysswifter, and we ended with money to send to the WECwork overseas.There were times before the end of the tour, however,when it looked as though the experiment were failing.One weekend we were holding meetings in Edinburgh. Wehad attracted a large group of young people the firstday and were casting about for a way to get them tocome back the next. Suddenly, without consultinganyone, one of the team members stood up and made anannouncement.'Before the meeting tomorrow evening,' he said, 'we'dlike you all to have tea with us here. Four o' clock.How many think they can make it?'A couple dozen hands went up, and we were committed.At first, instead of being delighted, the rest of uswere horrified. All of us knew that we had no tea, nocake, no bread and butter, and exactly five cups. Nordid we have money to buy these things: our last pennyhad gone to rent the hall. This was going to be a realtest of God's care.And for a while it looked as though He was going toprovide everything through the young peoplethemselves. After the meeting several of them cameforward and said they would like to help. One offeredmilk; another, half a pound of tea; another, sugar.One girl even offered to bring dishes. Our tea wasrapidly taking shape. But there was one thing stillmissing--the cake. Without cake, these Scottish boysand girls wouldn't consider tea tea.So that night in our evening prayer time, we put thematter before God. 'Lord, we've got ourselves into aspot. From somewhere we've got to get a cake. Will Youhelp us?'That night as we rolled up in our blankets on thefloor of the hall, we played guessing games: How wasGod going to give us that cake? Among the five of us,we guessed everything imaginable--or so we thought.Morning arrived. We half expected a heavenly messengerto come to our door bearing a cake. But no one came.The morning mail arrived. We ripped open the twoletters, hoping for money. There was none. A womanfrom a nearby church came by to see if she could help.'Cake,' was on the tip of all our tongues, but weswallowed the word and shook our heads.'Everything,' we assured her, 'is in God's hands.'The tea had been announced for four o' clock in theafternoon. At three the tables were set, but still wehad no cake. Three-thirty came. We put the water toboil. Three-forty-five.And then the doorbell rang.All of us together ran to the big front entrance, andthere was the postman. In his hand was a large box.'Hello, lads,' said the postman. 'Got something foryou that feels like a food package. ' He handed thebox to one of the boys. 'The delivery day is over,actually,' he said, 'but I hate to leave a perishablepackage overnight.'We thanked him profusely, and the minute he closed thedoor the boy solemnly handed me the box. 'It's foryou, Andrew. From a Mrs. William Hopkins in London.'I took the package and carefully unwrapped it. Offcame the twine. Off came the brown outside paper.Inside, there was no note--only a large white box.Deep in my soul I knew that I could afford the dramaof lifting the lid slowly. As I did, there, in perfectcondition, to be admired by five sets of wonderingeyes, was an enormous, glistening, moist, chocolatecake."":) It is a great book!

It is told in a simple, humble, yet gripping style. Brother Andrew relates his life story in many different stages: boy, young man, soldier, Christian, missionary, and Bible smuggler behind the Iron Curtain. He has such a devotion to the Lord that it cannot help but be inspiring. I am so grateful for the testimony of such a devoted Christian. God's Smuggler is also the story of Brother Andrew's spiritual journey. Even a few chapters into the book, you feel as though you are Brother Andrew's old friend and laugh and cry along with him. This book is heartbreaking in the descriptions of the persecution Christians faced under communism's thumb despite ""propaganda"" stating otherwise. This is especially important today - despite the fact that many western Christians are oblivious to it, persecution of Christians still goes on all around the world. Reading God's Smuggler may inspire people to become involved in supporting the Churches in countries where religious freedom is just a dream. I would highly recommend this book to everyone from spy-novel lover to dedicated Christian. Enjoy!",6556f284-8639-38a2-8c63-b80e7a720473,1159,12

This is the true story of Brother Andrew who is well known for smuggling bibles to beleaguered Christians behind the Iron Curtain. The story began with his childhood in Holland. His taste for daring and adventure showed up while he resisted the Nazis during their occupation of his country. He later joined the army, in search of adventure and meaning. He eventually found salvation, and dedicated his life to preach God's word. When he found out from Yugoslavian refugees that they had no access in their home country to the message of salvation, his life calling emerged.The story spans many of the countries that suffered under communist rule. The many lives he touched and was touched by are recorded for us to meet and learn from. The miracles of provision and eyes blinded to hidden bibles are stunning. His observations of life behind the iron curtain are amazing. The parallels between the communist education plan and our own public education system are frightening. This is one of those books that every Christian should read.",a78b39df-adc9-314c-9c13-a19f6d56aaa1,1200,11

I play as a single golfer, which is an advantage, as many courses are able to add me to an existing group, but the fact you are traveling with a larger group should not disuade you. You just need to plan further ahead. Don't be afraid to take a shot at this, as the savings are significant.

This is the best single resource for planning your own golf trip from the USA to Scotland, though there are a few limitations.1) Scotland has over 500 golf courses. The 68 selected in the book include all of the most expensive courses in Scotland. The book advises to think of this trip as "" your first golf trip to Scotland"" rather than the ""golf trip of a lifetime."" But subsequently orients the reader to the most expensive courses available. Notable areas that are barely covered in the book are the Northeast Coast with excellent courses such as Reay, Wick, Buckpool, Hopeman, Cullen, Arbroath and Inverllochy, though the author does mention Fraserburgh and Duff House Royal. Also the municipal courses of Aberdeen are not mentioned at all, but include a course designed by Alister Mackenzie and the original links of the Royal Aberdeen Club. Also there are 2 Fore 1 , Green Fee and Green Free vouchers where you can play many courses at 50% discount that are excellent courses. This is mentioned by the author but not noted in the course descriptions in the book.2) The lodging selections by the author also include the most expensive lodging in each town. Get on Google map or trip advisor and you can find excellent lodging in most towns for less than 50 pounds per person per night, some for less than 30 pounds.If you have the funds and want royal treatment then by all means enjoy. However if you wish to explore Scotland, rub elbows with the locals and get more bang for the buck, start with this book and get on the web and start looking around.

If I could take the works of only one sf author with me to a desert island, I would choose Zenna Henderson's &lt;&lt;Ingathering&gt;&gt;.",300a2423-0368-38d6-92da-707b291a6760,636,11

I'm drawn to the gritter, more hard-wired brand of science fiction, and these stories about the oh-so-wonderful People are just so darned sweet. Plus there's Henderson's writing...these stories read like she crocheted them while sitting in a rocking chair in front of a warm fire.But somehow, I just CAN'T dislike them. Henderson's stories of advanced aliens trying to survive among the knuckle-draggers of 19th and 20th century Earth, their struggle to remain true to their high ideals without betraying themselves, are immediately engrossing. And Henderson's plotting can grab you from the first sentence and pull you right along, never letting go. Her portrayal of the rural west is digital-clear.I highly recommend Henderson's People...five stars. Her afterword to the book, an explantion of how The People came to be written, is a hoot, and worth the price of admission. I also recommend reading the time-line at the end of the book...it will save you some confusion in placing the stories in time and place.",e797c3c0-105f-3499-bc0b-8016b45cc1a4,1084,10

Ralph Moody (aka Little Britches) tells us about his family's move from the East and their struggles and triumphs as they scrape a living from a ranch in Colorado. Ralph is 9 years old, with an older sister and several younger siblings. The book is much more than a chronology of interesting and exciting events-- much more. It is rich in the values of honesty, family unity, ingenuity, and the pride of doing a task well.There are many strong messages about building character -- earning trust, earning respect, and giving a man a good day's work. Ralph's wonderfully wise father is his primary teacher regarding the building of Ralph's ""character house"", but along the way Ralph meets other memorable men -- ""Hi"" the cowboy was our favorite. Ralph gets in several predicaments, doesn't always make the right choice, but takes to heart his father's wise counsel.This book is a true treasure. I would recommend it for ages 5 and up as a read aloud. 10 and up to be read alone. A great read for adults too -- a ""can't miss"" present.

Ralph's father Charlie, though reared on a farm in Maine, has worked for years in a New Hampshire woollen mill and suffers from lung trouble, and Cousin Phil, a mining-stock booster in Denver, manages to persuade reluctant Mother that in Colorado his health can be restored in a year and he ""can make as much money as he'd make here...in a lifetime."" As you might expect of a stock booster, Cousin Phil's predictions fall somewhat short of the reality--it may be the 20th Century, but life outside the cities isn't too different from what it was 30 or 40 years earlier: indoor toilets are unknown, and cowboys still carry six-guns as they ride the range. But the Moodys make the best of it. Father turns out to be a creative manager who swaps livestock shrewdly and trades work for the goods the family needs (one of my favorite scenes involves the moving entire of a disused bunkhouse, bigger than the whole three-room house that comes with their rented land, to create bedrooms for the children and a bigger kitchen), and a perceptive parent who teaches the lessons of character in a quiet, understandable way--and realizes that boys shouldn't be turned into Lord Fauntleroys or expected to always ""turn the other cheek."" Though the family sees barely $100 in cash in a year, they manage to eat well, send the children to school, enjoy good books and accumulate an impressive menagerie of domestic animals, and Ralph falls in love with the West (a love that will later be expressed in a long list of books about it, including several sequels to this one). There are moments of thrills (the windstorm that nearly destroys their house and forces them to crawl to shelter in a nearby gulch), joy (picnics in the mountains, Christmas feasts), quiet family togetherness (Mother reading aloud in the evenings), humor (like the fight between Jerry Alder and the Denver man while Ralph and his father are helping a neighbor with his threshing), and even danger (Father's participation in a battle over the neighborhood irrigation ditch, which culminates in what may be the first recorded attempt at a drive-by shooting), besides an assemblage of unforgettable characters--Fred Aultland, the rancher next door, who drives around at full speed in a buckboard drawn by two mettlesome bays, and his mother and sister; Hi, the cowboy, who becomes Ralph's idol (one of the best sequences in the book shows them breaking in a new young horse, the twin of Hi's own blue roan, and training the two in a precision trick-riding routine that takes first place at the annual rodeo), Mr. Thompson who claims to have known Kit Carson and his partner the Blackfoot Indian Two Dog who can gentle the wildest horse and cure the sickest, and of course Cousin Phil--and Father. Through their four years in Colorado, until Charlie dies of pneumonia, Ralph comes to know his father as he never did before, and to love and respect him for his ethics, his skills, his gentleness and firmness, and his understanding of the human condition. And in the end he emerges ready to become, at 12, the ""man of the family."" This is a book for families to enjoy and young and old to read independently, a book that shows something of the reality of pioneering and would fit splendidly into a homeschooling curriculum.

Ralph's own impetuosity and sneakiness land him in trouble, often requiring his parents' ingenuity and patience in meting out deserved, but character-buildihng, punishment. The seemingly incorrigible boy is a source of both pride and despair to his hard-working, honest parents, who strive to prevent their offspring from losing their gentlemanly upbringing in the wild Colorado boonies.Ralph must come of age in the family's first three and years as Westerners. He meets an old Indian named Two Dog with whom he establishes an immediate and lasting, though rarely verbal, friendship.

In the book, Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio, Peg comes to find that she has three different types of polio. She started off with just a muscle spasm, thinking it was no big deal. She later finds out she has polio. Then she finds out that not only does she have polio, but three different types. She meets a few people in her journey through different hospitals. This story is a page-turner; it's amazing to see how strong some people really are, not on the outside, but on the inside as well.This book is incredible. People think that their lives are so terrible, but really when you think about it, and you read this book, you realize things aren't as bad as they seem. I mean, I am not one that loves to read, but to hear someone else's story, and about there life, it's shocking. I honestly, would never be able to deal with what she went through. She went from hospital to hospital; she dealt with the mean nurse that made her put hot rags on her skin to help loosen her muscles. I would never be able to handle the stretching, and the hot rags or any of that. It shocked me to hear that polio can kill you. Some of the girls in the room that she stayed with had polio also, Alice has had it since she was little, and her family didn't want a blob sitting/laying around all day. One of the other girls had to lay in an iron-lung, because her lungs were not strong enough to let her breathe on her own. It's sad how none of them can walk very well because of polio. They either walk with walking sticks, wheelchairs, or they walk very slowly with out anything. I could not put the book down. I thought about my life compared to Peg's and the other girls, I would be stupid to try to make people feel bad for me considering what other people go through. I think anybody who likes biographies would enjoy this book. Like I said before, I am not a reader, but I could not put it down.

This happened to Peg after she got a disease called Polio. Peg was put in an intensive care unit at the nearest hospital and soon moved to another hospital for more intensive treatment. Peg was trapped inside a machine they refer to as the Iron Lung. After a few months she was released from that hospital only to go back to the one she was at before. But before she left she promised the doctor that she would come back and be able to walk for him. Will peg ever get to walk for him?I really liked this book because you want to keep reading and its full of excitement and disappointment like when Peg takes her first steps with her new walking sticks. As the story is being told Peg, the patient and the writer, is always telling her feelings and giving you insight to how she felt during that time. The feelings that you have for Peg go from happy to sad and excitement and anticipation, like when Peg first learned that she had Polio. I really like how Peg uses descriptive words and phrases to describe times like her Physical Therapy sessions, she called them Torture Time because the stretching was so stressful and hurt her very week and unused muscles. I personally don't have any complaints about this book, it was great!I would definitely recommend this book, ""Small Steps, The year I got Polio,"" to teens and older. It's a great easy read and awesome if you like to read reality books. If you like how this book sounds then go check it out!",754226c6-4dc0-3640-b070-62b97ea34ef9,1558,3

Pinkwater is one of the great storytellers and educator its around, and this book deserves as wide an audience as possible. It's that good. As usual, Pinkwater doesn't spend much time on developing a plausible plot: Things just happen, and, because of his dry matter-of-fact tone, you accept it. One day a seagull with a can of bright orange paint ""dropped the can (no one knows why) right over Mr. Plumbean's house."" The resulting big orange splot upsets the neighbors, who all live in identical brown housed with gray roofs and green shutters. When they ask him to paint his house (to get rid of the orange splot), Plumbean follows the letter--but not the spirit=-of their request. He paints the house red, yellow, green, and purple. He adds more splots, strikes, and ""elephants and lions and pretty girls and steam shovels.""The neighbors are aghast. In a recurring motif, the neighbors exclaim that something must be wrong with their neighbor: ""Plumbean has gushed his mush, lost his marbles, and slipped his hawser."" Mr. Plumbean resists their pressure, explaining in one of many memorable lines from the book: ""My house is me and I am it. My house...looks like all my dreams."" One by one, over tall glasses of lemonade, Mr. Plumbean casually talks to the other neighbors, one by one, about their own dreams. The following day, each neighbor expresses those dreams through his or her house.The book isn't so much about nonconformity as about self-expression, or what Maslow called ""self-actualization."" That everyone eventually paints their house in wild colors is not so much a new form of conformity, but rather the flowering and unafraid celebration of their individuality, and an acceptance of this in others. Very highly recommended; it may be a book you'll treasure for years to come.",dff429fa-8838-30cf-b0e5-649ec3562ea2,1956,47

Mr. Plumbean lives on a street called Neat St. All the houses are neat, and they are all very similar. One day a bird drops a big spot of orange paint on his house. The neighbors want him to repaint his house, to make the house look neat again. He repaints his house, but with lots of odd and strange colors and designs! All the neighbors are outraged and appalled; they think he's flipped his wig!I've read this book to kids, 3- to 5-year olds, and they think it's hilarious. I think most kids would love to strike out and look different, make unusual art, et cetera. The world of adults probably looks boring to lots of kids. But overly serious adults discourage kids from looking or acting too far from accepted norms. Mr. Plumbean, and his creator Mr. Pinkwater, show kids that it's okay for your house to look different, and for you to be different!My only quibble with this book: after Plumbean changes the looks of his house, the neighbors complain for a while, then ALL the other neighbors change the looks of their houses as well, to look like their dreams, as did Mr. Plumbean. It's a bit of a stretch. Did they ALL want to change their houses? Isn't that a bit of conformity in itself? If at least one guy had left his house the way it was, and said &quot;my house always looked like my dreams,&quot; (surely, Plumbean and all of his newly enlightened neighbors would approve) it would have seemed more in keeping with the &quot;be yourself&quot; theme of the book. As it is, all the neighbors seem to be hopping on the bandwagon.Out in the real world, not everyone wants to have a goofy looking house (or outfit, or car), regardless of what other people think. Anyway, that's my quibble. I give this book 4 stars. Little kids (and older kids, also, apparently) really love it!RESOLVE TO BUY THIS HUMOROUS BOOK.ken32",abe738f3-af86-3000-bfff-18b55a372b69,1885,20

I own every book, and have recently reread them all, and without a doubt this is the very best. For one thing, it was written right in the middle of Watterson's C&H career, which means that the writing and ideas are still fresh, while super-improved drawings and Sunday strips have just begun. Second of all, Watterson must have been on a powerful creative streak, because there is an amazing number of stories within the ""Indispensible"" collection. There are three Rosalyn babysitter tales, the bug collection story, the bat project, two camping trips, G.R.O.S.S. adventures, the burglar break in, the car down the hill, multiple Stupendous Mans, multiple Spaceman Spiff getaways, the duplicator going ""boink"" and creating more Calvin's, a rare, great Tracer Bullet story, Calvin defying gravity and size, Calvin on the baseball team, and a time machine adventure to the dinosaur age. The sheer amount of stories here is unheard of for a C&H collection, and the best part is that almost every one is fantastic. Thirdly, the Sunday strips are in color, which is a huge plus. Fourthly, Calvin's parents have finally been rendered as three dimensional and sympathetic individuals, a characteristic that had been lacking in the earlier books. Last of all, as always, these comics are frequently hilarious, sometimes touching, and always entertaining. This collection personifies those characteristics to the nth degree, and is without a doubt the best Calvin and Hobbes for anyone to buy. If you're looking for other good C&H books, I would also recommend the Essential Collection (first two books, funny yet lacking in drawing), Snow Goons, Psycho Jungle Cat, Treasure Everwhere, and the 10th Anniversary. I hope this was helpful both for prospective buyers, and old fans looking back.",ffe5f189-c886-3b02-b06c-a8faa7fc0c9a,1866,99

What else can I say?,"Fans of Calvin &amp; Hobbes who used to read the newspaper strip in the 80s and 90s will find great pleasure in reading this treasury of C&amp;H comics. These witty comics about the 6-year old Calvin and his stuffed tiger Hobbes, named after the famous philosophers, will amuse people of all ages. The perceptiveness and humor of Watterson deserve the highest of cartoon awards, while his artistic creations exude hilarity. This cartoon is perhaps one of the most piercing yet funny critiques of modern society.This book starts out with Calvin praying for snow so he can engage in one of his favorite hobbies: sledding, and then his other favorite hobby, throwing snowballs at Susie. Aside from the snowman exhibition, this book is a must-have since it covers the founding of C&amp;H's GROSS (the Get Rid of Slimy girlS club). This also has the hilarious series about the time Calvin's personal gravity polarity reversed, and the episode when the Transmogrifier becomes the Duplicator.Note that there are two series of C&amp;H collections: individual wide-format albums, each covering an entire year of strips (will call it &quot;regular&quot;), and the vertical aspect ratio &quot;treasury series&quot; which covers selected comics from two regular C&amp;H books. Note that C&amp;H ran for a year in newspapers, so there's 10 regular books and 5 treasury books. Though the cartoons are slightly smaller in the treasury collection, each treasury book is far thicker and contains more strips than a regular book, and is furthermore less expensive, so treasury books are a real bargain. &quot;The Indispensable Calvin &amp; Hobbes&quot; belongs to the Treasury collection, and was first released in 1992.",0434141d-7d7c-3e13-92e6-8c02ce38c5ba,1702,15

Calvin is a rebellious rapscallion of a little boy who lives a life filled with picaresque adventures and imaginary exploits. His imagination and personality are boundless, yet he is a total failure in school, he has no human friends, and he is bullied. Despite his poor grades, he exhibits an astounding vocabulary and often muses on the deeper aspects of life. Calvin struggles in the real world but that doesn't bother him because he knows what truly matters in life: friendship (he has a very close one with Hobbes), adventure, and imagination. And he's irresistibly charismatic despite his flaws.The other main characters are strong supporters. Hobbes is essential to Calvin's well-being, and most of Calvin's exploits take place with Hobbes at his side. They scuffle, but they love each other. Every day when Calvin comes home from school, Hobbes is waiting to pounce on him in joyous greeting. Calvin is annoyed to be tackled every day, but deep down he cherishes it; without that daily pounce, what would Calvin's life be? Calvin's parents take background roles in the strip, since the protagonists are the boy, his stuffed tiger, and the world he lives in, but they are calming presences, always stepping in when Calvin gets in too much trouble. Sometimes they're a little strict, but they're good role models. Susie, the neighborhood girl, always tries to be friendly with him but Calvin, in an age-old young boy's strive to assert his masculinity, insists that she is gross and constantly picks on her in a light-hearted manner. Many strips, however, just involve Calvin and Hobbes, getting into trouble, discussing ideas, exploring, relaxing...One would be a complete curmudgeon whose heart is not warmed by this touching, happy, and filled-with-life exploration of the mind and adventures of a young boy. As long as Calvin is dreaming up Spaceman Spiff adventures while stuck in a desk at school, as long as he and his tiger are taking walks in the forest or wild wagon rides down and off of cliffs while philosophizing about life, as long as Calvin is pelting Susie with snowballs on a cozy winter day, and as long as Calvin and Hobbes are running and jumping in the backyard in a rollicking game of Calvinball, there is peace in this world.",711e1220-1fa5-3616-8269-2f2fedbe91b8,2335,4

At the time, Smith simply sold a few stories to a few SF mags, but it turns out that they were interconnected vignettes from a vast future universe and mythology that Smith was creating in his mind for decades. This vast fictitious universe covers the development of man over tens of thousands of years and across the galaxy, in an expansive style that is reminiscent of Frank Herbert. Meanwhile, Smith's method of creating narratives as if they were told by an old storyteller, even farther in the future, could be compared to J.R.R. Tolkien, who also created his own universe and history of tremendous proportions.Smith was a storyteller of remarkable literary ability, as he explored scientific advances without getting too technical, and introduced very heavy themes of humanity and morality without lapsing into preachy conclusions. Very few writers in any genre have this kind of ability for kicking off deep speculation and introspection in the reader. Just about all of the many stories here explore the re-emergence of real humanity after many millennia of human dispersal across the universe, with a few glimpses of mirth or action amidst general darkness and melancholy.A few stories of note include the disturbing ""A Planet Named Shayol"" in which humans are farmed for body parts on a deceptively tranquil prison planet; ""Think Blue, Count Two"" which describes what could really happen on a typical SF mothership transporting humans for hundreds of years to a new space colony; ""When the People Fell"" which very creepily explores how regular people will be used for space colonization; or ""The Crime and the Glory of Commander Suzdal"" in which Smith twists time travel and even history in remarkable humanistic ways. Of special note to SF historians is ""War No. 81-Q"" which lampoons the fallacy of war for profit and entertainment, a form of satire that's unbelievable for a story first written way back in the 1920s (and Smith was in high school at the time to boot). Those are just a few of the tremendous stories in this collection by an author who richly deserves to be treated as a grand master in his field. The sheer breadth and depth of Smith's literary universe is simply astonishing. [~doomsdayer520~]",a1e6cef2-e93b-3c67-988e-26cb132a10b7,2449,58

There aren't that many of them - but they are so wonderful they can be read and read and read again. And they never lose their freshness for me. I read 'The Game of Rat and Dragon' to my wife one night when she was having trouble getting to sleep. Perhaps it's not his greatest story, but it is so humane, so all-encompassing of the best of humankind and so wonderful to the animals that we share this world with - specifically cats in this case (and for anyone who has been fortunate enough to share at least part of their lives with cats it will probably raise so many memories).So I took down my favourite anthology - the 1970 Panther Books edition published under the title 'Under Old Earth' and started to refresh the Cordwainer Smith experience. As I read the wonderful 'A Planet Named Shayol' (there is nothing like this anywhere!) the tears rose in my eyes again. This involuntary response told me so much!!! Here's a quote:'It's unfair,' cried the half-man. 'They should be punished as we were!'The Lady Johanna Gnade looked down at him. 'Punishment is ended. We will give you anything you wish, but not the pain of another.'What a vision! The only comparable one I can think of is the words Gustav Mahler wrote about the day of judgement scene in his second symphony. After the trumpets sound and the dead are raised Mahler reasoned that there would be neither reward nor punishment - only God's heavenly love would remain.I cannot compromise the five star average rating for these stories.

A short list of the stories in this volume that you MUST read would include: &quot;Alpha Ralpha Boulevard&quot;, &quot;The Game of Rat and Dragon&quot;, &quot;A Planet Called Shayol&quot;, &quot;Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons&quot;, and the aforementioned &quot;Dead Lady of Clown Town.&quot;The title of one of Smith's collections that originally contained many of these stories was You Will Never Be the Same.

Taylor,11/11,5.0,965952000,Rediscover Cordwainer Smith,"Cordwainer Smith began publishing science fiction in the fifties when Amazing Stories and other science fiction fanzines primarily flew rockets to outer space and beyond. Smith, however, took the common themes of pulp science fiction and made them into something alien and new. Ships did travel through space, but they were hunted by beings of pure malevolence, and saved by cats chasing imaginary mice. People themselves become alien adjusting their physiology to fit worlds that otherwise could not support life. Animals and robots become more than human by acting with intelligence, compassion, and love often exceeding that of their masters.Smith's stories are not hard science; they read more like fairy tales or myths. However, The Rediscovery of Man is the myths of mankind's future, myths showing the potential for both dreams and nightmares to come true. These are stories for children thousands of years hence, and for adults today. Just like myths and fairy tales, Smith's stories have great truths in them that are often hidden by an entertaining story.This collection is a fascinating glimpse into the human mentality. Individually, a few of these stories stand out as his best writing, but the collection as a whole is a beautiful work that leads you through one of the most imaginative minds in science fiction.",eb067ff2-2be6-3595-9e77-ff56fc3fce9a,1326,11

Britzman,10/10,5.0,1053475200,Humanity's Strange Future History,"Like Heinlein, Smith built a detailed future history of the human race as a backdrop for his writing. It starts at the end of WWII and continues tens of thousands of years into the future. Smith spent much of his childhood in Asia, as the son of a diplomat,and grew up to become an expert in Asian culture and affairs, as well as politics in general and psychology in particular. Many of Smith's stories are rewrites of Chinese myths and fables, with casts of characters out of his often dreamlike human universe, governed by the Instrumentality.Interestingly, even within this vast sweep of time, Smith's Instrumentality never chances upon a single alien race, despite the eventual development of various and increasingly efficient techniques of FTL travel. At a few points in ""The Rediscovery of Man"" Smith mentions various of the Instrumentality's preparations for possible alien encounters, but only modified and/or forgotten sub-species of humans are ever discovered.The word ""dark"" gets used a lot in describing Smith's work, deriving from such things as the subjugation of the Underpeople, the practice of memory-wiping and the pervasive,paternalistic and all-powerful Instrumentality.But most importantly, Smith's personal history is one of witnessing events from the viewpoint of those who are leading (or manipulating) the rest of us, and it is the appearance of this unique understanding in his writing that gives it it's edge, and that element of darkness. The Instrumentality is a shadow government- for the most part staying out of daily life for billions of people in far-flung planets and empires. But it does have altruistic agendas, that require adjustments to the large scale flow of human development, at times, which take the form of both guidance and retribution. At it's highest level, the arc of the story told by all the stories in ""Rediscovery Of Man"", taken together, is about the Instrumentality finally realizing that humans, as a species now spread out over thousands of light years, do best when controls are minimal, hence the title.But the wonderfully offbeat technology is pure imagination-such as the ""laminated mouse brain"" containing a guardian hologram for a young girl on an interstellar journey in the story ""Think Blue, Count Two"",or Old North Australia's strange and fearsome planetary defense system in ""Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons""; a directed-telepathy weapon powered by the lethal hostility harvested from the minds of specially-bred psychotic weasels.One could actually hope that humanity turns out as exotic, abstract and imaginative (and as long-lasting!) as Smith envisioned. If you are a scifi buff but are unfamiliar with Smith's work, there is a gaping hole in your expertise that you can now remedy with a single, chronologically-ordered volume of stories. If scifi isn't your bag, I guarantee you still will be seduced and enchanted and transfixed by this relatively small body of work which, like the writing of Stanislaw Lem, raises speculative fiction to the level of literature.",f0482794-9b3a-3a42-922f-2c423fc67b55,3040,10

Although the contents of this volume represent more than half of his entire science-fictional output, what he lacked in quantity he made up for in superb and very different quality. His prose is colored by some very non-standard phrasing and imagery, at least some of which came from his close connections with Chinese culture (his god-father was Sun Yat-sen, and he was a close confidant of Chiang Kai-shek). There is a feeling, an ambience to his stories that I have never seen even approximated by any other author. But the themes he tackled in his stories are ones that everyone can relate to, covering prejudice, greed, lust for power, crime and appropriate punishment, and the seeming boundless desire to go where no man has gone before.Perhaps the main highlight of this collection is ""The Dead Lady of Clown Town"", which is a very forceful retelling of the Joan of Arc story. I ended up in tears at the end of this one when I first read it, and subsequent re-reads haven't lessened its impact. I've had this one in my top ten `best of sf' short fiction list since my first encounter with it.""A Planet Named Shayol"" will make you do some heavy thinking about just what can or should be done to punish a society's law (or custom) breakers, or if punishment is ever even really justifiable at all, and will give you a nightmare vision of just what hell on Earth (or any other planet) just might be like.""The Ballad of Lost C'Mell"" may be the centerpiece of his entire envisioned future history, as the Instrumentality of Mankind, which for centuries has managed the human population to avoid disease, war, or hard labor (for which tasks the Underpeople were created), is driven to the conclusion that a viable civilization must have some dark elements, as championed by Lord Jestocost and girly-girl Cat-person C'Mell.Almost all of the stories here are part of Smith's envisioned universe governed by the Instrumentality, a vision that stretches from near-Earth future to a very distant far-future galaxy where humanity has spread almost everywhere. Smith clearly has some overriding messages: his fear of all-powerful ruling bodies, his attachment to all forms of life and the respect that each individual should have, and a basic belief in the power and utility of religion. All the details of this universe are not filled in, and it is sometimes the tantalizing glimpses of what he does not describe that will capture your imagination, and your wish that there were more stories about this unique world. His Underpeople are marvelous creations, showing not only those traits normally associated with the best of humanity, but also characteristics of their underlying animal heritage, whether it be cat, dog, or turtle.Not every story here is a gem, most especially those not set in his Instrumentality universe or those dealing with the very near future. But they are all very readable, and the overall level of quality here is absurdly high. Read this first. Then take on his only sf novel, Norstrilia. You won't regret it.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)",042223c0-529f-3a5d-b190-5ccb5bacee4f,3104,10

A closer look revealed a small cluster of six tiny stars. ""Hmmm,"" I said to myself,""I wonder what that is?"" I remembered an old book I had on my shelf called ""The Stars."" So went and after a quick search, realized that the cluster was called the Pleiades and they are part of Taurus. ""Cool,"" I thought, and I sat down to read the whole book through.This is my all-time favorite book from my youth. I have many, many memeories of me and my dad spending hours up on the roof at night, looking at this book through our red-painted flashlight, naming the stars and tracing the constellations. We did this at least once a week for several years, during all seasons. Even to this day, almost 40 years later, I look up in the sky and immediately see old and comforting friends that haven't changed since then. And I feel like I know where I am.Then during college, I took a photocopy of the book to Kenya, where I lived for a semester in the bush. This time, Kenya being on the equator, I had the pleasure of meeting new friends; the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere. Way cool.I have given this book as a gift to friends, children of friends, just about anyone who I have seen glancing into the nightime sky.So now I just bought myself a brand new copy; I'm going to Sri Lanka to help with disaster relief and, alas, my original cloth-bound hardcover 1962 edition is just to old to make the journey with me. However, I am very eager to re-aquaint myself with those friends I first made back in the African sky.I have to say that Rey's method for showing the constellations outdoes everyone elses: Gemeni looks like two stick figures (note the cover illustration), Orion a hunter, Scorpio a scorpion, etc. Every other illustration I have ever seen has shown the constellations as apparently random lines between random points. This makes it nearly impossible to see the constellations for what they are. And I don't understand why other publication such as magazines and newspapers don't use Rey's system. Copyright issues, perhaps?This book is an amazing gift that will inspire you and/or your kids, and it's a great way to spend time and bond with him/her/them. I take it whenever I travel, and I always find it is a great way to get people, young and old, curious, excited, and interacting.

After renewing it as many times as I could, my mother bought me a copy. This book started a lifetime love of observational Astronomy that continues to this day. I still have that very book now--it is worn, marked, ripped, and the cover has fallen off--but it is still a book that I pull out from time to time.Rey's method of teaching Astronomy is to keep things as simple and basic as possible. If all you want to do is recognize the constellations in the sky and know when to see them, then you read the first three chapters. If you want to learn a bit more about celestial mechanics, then you read further. You learn as much as you want to. Rey's outlines of the constellations are innovative in that that really LOOK like what the constellations are supposed to represent. The first time I used this book to find constellations (at age eight) I was able to pick out a few even in the light polluted skies of the SF Bay Area.The only criticism that I have for this book (which only popped up when I reached adulthood) is that in order to draw some of his realistic outlines of the constellations, Rey needed to incorporate a number of faint stars that can only be seen in areas that have very dark skies at night. Under such conditions there are so many stars peppering the heavens (that are not on Rey's charts) that an amateur could be overwhelmed and get lost. Despite this quibbling, I still consider this book to be the best introductory work on Astronomy around, no matter what age the reader. I've seen lots of other ""Astronomy 101"" books--some are good, some are great, but after 50 years of being in print, ""The Stars"" has yet to be beat.",0fcdc8c5-83a9-3cd9-8e07-dcafba2bba4d,1706,23

This is not a childrens' book. Even though decades have passed since it was first published, no other text has been able to bump it off a 'best in class' position. If you want to look to the sky for familiar shapes, this is the book for you.There are a couple of fundamental ways to study the heavens. A 'modern' approach might be to put your head down, click in a few celestial coordiantes, and wait for the telescope to find a target for you. However a more interesing approach would be to find shape in the sky and locate targets manually. To do that you need to recognize those old landmarks in the sky, the constellations.The big problem in identifying constellations is to find shape from seemingly random dots. Ray creatively used the same stars, but made 'new' stick diagrams that actually look like what they are supposed to represent. This makes a constellation much easier to visualize, remember, and recognize later. Other texts that attempt this effort fall short because they don't emphasize visual recognition clues.A major fault of modern texts is the inclusion of unnecessary detail. Ray puts in a few choice details that help the memory and add interesting character to the figures in the sky. But by excluding minutia he draws the reader back to the goal at hand. Ultimately you need to memorize a blueprint of the sky, and this workbook will be your best friend to help reach that goal. Bravo.",fba4ae25-7fec-3fa8-98be-337f3b1b6497,1463,18

A. Rey, the author of the ""Curious George"" books (no relation to me!). _The Stars: A New Way to See Them_ was first written in 1952. Houghton-Mifflin's 3rd edition, dated 1973, is available in bookstores and online at Amazon.com. I recently picked up a used 1966 edition.Rey's book was written for children to help them learn to recognize the constellations. As you may know, few of the constellations seem to resemble the character or object they are supposed to represent. It takes an awfully good imagination to see Bootes as a shepherd, or Auriga as a charioteer, or Aries as a ram. Rey takes those same star patterns and rearranges the lines to produce stick figures that actually look like something. Not only that, they have the appearance of the intended object or character of mythology. Perseus looks like he's coming to Andromeda's rescue. Monoceros looks like a stick-figure unicorn, and Camelopardalis looks like a skinny giraffe.Rey's book _The Stars_ is laid out in four parts: Part 1 is ""Shapes in the Sky"", where he describes old and new ways of arranging the stars. Part 2 is ""Meet the Constellations"", where he shows a diagram of each constellation and gives a bit of information about it. In Part 3, ""The Stars Throughout the Year"" he has twelve sets of calendar charts - with and without the lines drawn in -- and explains that the sky is always changing, as the earth travels in its path around the sun. Additional calendar charts include viewing areas farther north and south than most of us are familiar with. Part 4, ""Some Whys and Hows"" goes into some technical details on the celestial sphere, the path of the ecliptic, why we have seasons, the earth's orbit, solar and sidereal time, precession, and other topics for those with an inquiring scientific mind. It is not necessary to read or understand this section to enjoy the book, but it adds to its value as a learning tool. Rey tells about the moon and its phases, gives a good description of a cross-section of the Milky Way galaxy, and gives some facts about the planets. The planetary tables won't do me much good in the twenty-first century, though. My 1966 edition has planetary tables from 1961 through 1970. The newer edition may have updated tables, however. A 2001 reviewer of the book on Amazon.com says it has planetary tables for the next ten years.The back pages of the book contain a good index and glossary, a whole-sky chart, an index to the constellations by their English names and by their classical Latin names, and a list of the twenty brightest stars. Hans Augusto Rey has provided enough information in this little 160-page book to satisfy any ""Curious George"", me included.>Now, if you prefer the classical representations of the constellations, you might not care for Rey's rearrangement of their appearance. For instance, the tail of the Great Bear becomes her nose, and Hercules's body becomes his head. But at least the figures are memorable, and if it helps kids - or adults - to learn the star patterns in the night sky, I would say it has accomplished a lot. I highly recommend this book to stargazers everywhere, young or old. Amateur astronomers can use it to help young people and astronomy novices get comfortable with wandering the skies at night.",152766d8-3671-3264-bbc6-6cc5b4aff2a4,3316,16

Stunned when he learns what his wife did that broke the Commandant and the key principle to his reign, an irate Hezekiah devastates the pagan shrine. However, he is severely injured because of his berserker ranting. Once calm he knows his country's future is at stake so he turns to God for help and forgiveness for him, his wife, and their people. God answers through the prophet Isaiah who provides direction to clean his house and to select his heir.The third tome of the fabulous Chronicles of the Kings series, THE STRENGTH OF HIS HAND, offers a terrific look at King Hezekiah's reign at a time of moral and religious crisis that threatens to destroy all he believed in and worked to achieve. Interestingly, the transgression of worshipping the false god by Hephzibah was done out of love for her spouse (good intentions can be an express way to hell).

Outstanding once again!!","Wow! That's the only word that comes to mind after reading Lynn Austin. I picked this up with one lingering doubt in my mind, ""Will this even match books 1 and 2?"" They were THAT good, and Lynn Austin did her homework to the nth degree, and I'm sitting here astounded! I was wondering if she'd include Sannacherib, Hezekiah's fierce, taunting rival! Oh, she did all right, and had me sweating a time or two! She did an amazing work, and if you have yet to read this, you really are missing out. I really don't feel like putting the book down when I'm on my lunch break at work, or potty training the 2 year old, and it made me all the more crazy to get back to reading!! Yeah, now read on, right? I still have my review to do!The theme in this would ultimately have to be trust. And for that matter, not trusting in ourselves. To me that is a gut wrenching matter. Especially when I think I need something, and it just ain't happening! When you look back on the times when you haven't trusted God, please don't feel so bad. It is called crisis, and we all go through it. King Hezekiah went through it, and he HAD to trust God. The question is, would he? If you know the story, well then you already know the answer. But let's not make it so obvious. What about Hezekiah's wife, Hephzibah, who has yet to birth a future king? She thought she was promised, yet no baby, not yet anyway! What about other people in this that we've grown to love... like Eliakim? The Assyrians are planning to attack Judah. Eliakim's wife, Jerusha knows about how beastly ONE of them can be. Will God protect them? Will they rely on God's strength, or will they lean to their own understanding? Isaiah, the prophet is still alive and well in this whole mess, and he plays a big part!This also gives a better understanding of Passover. With a portrait more real than life, the passover is displayed to me in great awe. It really drives home the point, like for instance with the parsley dipped in salt water. Just an example, and you might really appreciate what an awesome God we serve after this. There is a lot of scripture, yet when you see it come alive, WOW!All God asks sometimes is to simply trust Him. To put aside our strength, and to simply trust Him. Is it always easy? No way. Is it worth it? Yes it is, because I know from some tough experiences. Outstanding once again, Lynn Austin! I'm ready for more.",8c450700-f4d7-3a2f-be52-188b0012ad83,2394,9

(Preface)The Puritans recognized that prayer and doctrine are not to be separated. In their prayers they kept the two together. In fact it was their doctrinal understanding, which indeed produced such deep, and lasting prayers. Theology instilled a thorough passion for prayer. Likewise it is prayer, which sinks us deeper into the mysteries of God's self-disclosure of himself. It is prayer, which furthers our theology.It is to this end which we, as Christians must strive. We must search out our Triune God in prayer and devotion as we seek him in his word and through our prayers.Arthur Bennett has provided the Church a great service by collecting the prayers of the saints. The book is arranged topically under the following headings: 1. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; 2. Redemption and Reconciliation; 3. Penitence and Deprecation; 4. Needs and Devotions; 5. Holy Aspirations; 6. Approach to God; 7. Gifts of Grace; 8. Service and Ministry; 9. Valediction; 10. A Week's Shared Prayers.This book is excellent for both private and public devotion. The only disadvantage I found to the book was that each individual prayer was not attributed to its corresponding author. However this is probably a good idea in keeping with the intent of the book. Its intention is as a guide to lead us to prayer when the heart is cold or to further pour fuel on the heart, which is already aflame.May this be used of the Lord to ignite our hearts in a holy passion toward him.

Nickles III,66/68,5.0,1078790400,A Glimpse of Puritan Spirituality,"I can read about three or four prayers before being overwhelmed by the depth and riches of these prayers. They show the depth of knowledge and wisdom of their writers, but even more they show the writers' deep abhorrence of their sin and devotion to God. They also show keen insight into the private sins of our hearts. These prayers are old; I had to frequently consult a dictionary to understand some words that are no longer in common use. I can't help but feel that Christianity in our day is terribly shallow compared to what the Puritans knew.Each prayer is about one page long, has a brief title given by the book's editor, and is presented anonymously. The prayers are grouped into sections such as &quot;Redemption and Reconciliation,&quot; &quot;Holy Aspirations,&quot; and &quot;Approach to God.&quot; A brief preface is the only background given, all the rest of the book is simply the prayers themselves.I have only two faults with the book, but neither merit rating it less than five stars. First, the titles of the sections closely describe the main theme of that section, but the titles of the individual prayers do not consistently (in my mind) state the main theme of that prayer. Second, the prayers are not attributed to their authors, and I would very much like to know who wrote each one. However, I will allow that perhaps Arthur Bennett intended for us not to know so we would focus on the Creator rather than the creature.One other thing to mention is that this is one of the most sturdy, well-published paperback books I have seen. After carrying this book on my commute to work for reading, it has held up much better than other paperbacks. The pages were so thick I often had to check the page numbers to make sure I had not skipped a page.I highly recommend this book for all Christians for personal study to receive greater conviction of sin, more language to express your devotion to God, and instruction on how to pray fervently.",65417eb5-9761-356e-ad13-ac0ae6b1865b,1961,66

Personally, I would have liked to have been able to go to the original sources and read more by the authors.For those who are looking for modern language prayers, be forewarned that this book retains much of the flavor of the Puritan English.But even with these minor criticisms, I have to admit I have been touched by the prayers in this book many times. I regularly use this book to help focus my time with God.If you want a boost in your devotional time with God, &quot;The Valley of Vision&quot; won't be a disappointment.",98f8faf4-77f2-3d68-bc86-45d0918e6ab7,1190,26

I owned the original paperback, and now am very pleased to have this new bonded leather version (complete with ribbon bookmark).These men of faith prayed Scripturally informed, joyous, repentant prayers that never left any doubt that God was the focus, and that pleasing and praising and enjoying Him was the goal of the prayers. Here is just a small sample:&quot;O Lover of the Loveless, it is thy will that I should love thee with heart, soul, mind, strength, and my neighbor as myself. But I am not sufficient for these things. There is by nature no pure love in my soul; Every affection in me is turned from thee; I am bound, as slave to lust, I cannot love thee, lovely as thou art, until thou dost set me free. By grace I am thy freeman and would serve thee, for I believe thou art my God in Jesus, and that through him I am redeemed, and my sins forgiven.&quot; (pp. 250).There is a wonderful sense of joy, hope and love, mixed with seriousness, repentance, and faith. I turn to these prayers again and again when my heart is hard, my mind lacks the right words, or when I am tempted. At our church, we often include prayers from this work in our bulletin for folks to meditate on as they prepare for worship. They are also wonderful for 'jump starting' your own personal worship and prayer times with the Lord. Get a copy today - you won't regret it!",d3fe3362-0553-3273-a591-7dd83fb1cd47,1591,13

The quote is followed by a story, advice, explanation, life application of the thought of the day, or similar text. Then the page is concluded with the affirmation for the day. While I did not particularly like many of the affirmations and found some of them patronizing, I did enjoy some of them. To me the value of the book is in each page's very appropriate quote and the rest of the page right up to the affirmation. Others may find the affirmations valuable. A very good book that I have no hesitations recommending, it was a joy to read.",4b865d77-e0b5-3dc8-9f9d-e941b595b9e7,1357,4

It is a call to prayer. It is a much needed rebuke of our spiritual laziness and apathy (Amos 4:1). We need men and women of faith to rise up and pray with all their might (1 Samuel 12:23; 1 Thess. 5:17). The sad reality is that the early Church was birthed in prayer (Acts 1:14) but today's church knows nothing of prayer.

This book is a prophetic call to the Church to wake up and be the Church of God. I picked up this book as it was highly recommended in another book that impacted me (Growing Deep in God by Edmund Chan), and I have found it deeply ministering.Ravenhill writes with many one liners that cuts to the chase in the heart of the matter that he is communicating. Phrases like ""No man is greater than his prayer life. The pastor who is not praying is playing; the people who are not praying are straying"", ""Many pray, but few have faith"", ""God does not want partnership with us, but ownership of us"", and ""Our eyes are dry because our hearts are dry"" are just some of these phrases that speak mountains of the situation in the Church today.I do not agree with everything Ravenhill writes about, but I read beyond the words and understand his heart from which he writes this book. Ravenhill's desire for God comes across strongly, and anything that is apart from God or does not seem to fit into his godly values would seem as ""sin"" and hence to be dealt with. Hence, I recommend this book to your reading (and read beyond the words to catch the fire that burns in Ravenhill's heart), and also Edmund Chan's Growing Deep in God. I find that as I read these 2 books, it is like God doing an open heart surgery on me, revealing the true nature of my heart so that I can repent and have God place a new heart in me (Ezekiel 36:26).",f5071992-22e9-31ff-95b5-de92c483cd73,1519,29

Ravenhill argues that this is not something that happens overnight. If the Church wants revival, it's going to come with a cost.

I have noted that there will be a fourth, most advanced book in this series called ""More Unbeatable Chess for Juniors"" (expanding on ""Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors"").BACKGROUND:""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors"" was published in 2004 and is the third book in the series. The author, Robert Snyder's students won numerous National Championships. After doing research I found that the author is a strong master, rated USCF over 2300 and internationally over 2400. He also has produced 36 first place championship winners at national championships (a national record). His chess teams travel around the world and nation on a regular basis and compete. The author has extensive experience in introducing chess to beginners holding another record by having taught over 170,000 children at school programs over many years.STRUCTURE OF ""WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS"": This is the perfect book to continue from the author's ""Chess for Juniors"" book. It is designed as a training guide and also provides a lot of structured material for study to compliment the other books in the series.There are eight chapters many of which cover a lot of material not seen in other books. This makes ""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors"" very unique! I consider this a good thing. I found that this book is just packed with information that will help you do much better in tournaments, and in many cases can make the difference between you becoming a great player or lapsing into a disorganized state. You are certain to be making many mistakes that this book will correct! Because of what ""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors"" covers it is difficult to explain its structure without looking at the material covered. I will say that this book contains some extreme humor that goes way beyond the basic ""Chess for Juniors"" book. Kids may fall out of their chair laughing.MATERIAL COVERED:a. Chapter One is all about what it takes to be a successful tournament competitor. It will help you know exactly what to look for when trying to find the right chess teacher for you. It suggests other books for reading and helps you to form a good, well rounded chess library. It covers how you should practice and gives good ideas and advice (i.e. it tells why playing irregular forms of chess like bughouse hurts your overall game). It explains how to condition your self for tournaments.b. Chapter Two tells you all about how tournaments work (parents should read this and the first chapter!). You will learn the inner workings of the most important tournament rules (including some complicated ones) that is guaranteed to help you do better in tournaments. Getting the rule book alone is not good enough. It doesn't explain how to use these rules to your favor or what to watch out for. ""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors"" will make you a shark in the sea of rules!c. Chapter Three is on Chess Psychology. I haven't seen any other books that cover the practical use of chess psychology that are directed at a scholastic player. I want to say this is the most useful chapter yet, but then realize just how important the other ones are - so I won't go there! Setting realistic goals in chess, building self confidence, what to actually do during play and the reasons why we make mistakes in analysis is the main focus of this absolutely fantastic chapter.d. Chapter Four is all about preparing an opening system. I found it to provide not only very important ideas in what to look for in your own openings, but how to set up the main lines of your system in chart form for easy study. An actual complete opening system is provided - so you in effect also find this book to be an opening book! It doesn't provide the ideas behind the moves in the system it provides, but you will find that the ideas behind the moves to the exact opening system it provides are found in the other books in the series.e. Chapter Five is a complete tactics workbook! It organizes the most important tactics for you to learn by type of pattern. It is rather comprehsensive and this is the largest chapter in the book.f. Chapter Six is on the endgame. The author continues with the most important endgames from where his ""Chess for Juniors"" book left off. I you combine these two books you have comprehensive coverage of all the basic endgames.g. Chapters Seven and Eight are on six of the author's national scholastic chess champions. Each player has at least one game with analysis along with pictures and information on the life of these superkids. You will find the games and players to be interesting.WHO IS THIS BOOK IS FOR:I would recommend this book for children ages 9 on up of average reading ability or better, or for adults (don't be fooled by the ""Juniors"" in the title in these books as they are just as much for adults). A knowledge of basic strategy (as covered in ""Chess for Juniors"") is necessary to get the full value of this book. If you are a player rated above 700 and under 1900 you will find you are at the right levels for this book. Consider getting the author's ""Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors"" book as it perfectly compliments this one with additional and non-repetitious material (an advantage of reading the entire series by this author). I would recommend getting the author's most advanced book, ""More Unbeatable Chess for Juniors"" which I have been informed will be out in May, 2005 and will expand on ""Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors"" with many current games and a heavy focus on opening theory but keeping the concept of analyzing very move in every game (I cannot wait until it comes out!).",6d5e3c84-76f6-3f4c-9408-fe1b6fbb6d2e,5842,435

Now a year later my rating has jumped to over 1450 and I gained way over 400 rating points!Some of the things that this book helped me with is telling me about what to do to study and exactly how to study from material. I can see that most players do this wrong and will learn much more slowly. But this book will put you in the right direction.It helped with teaching why I make mistakes in how I think. It helps teach you to use rules to your favor (there was a lot I didn't know that the regular rule book doesn't explan well). I liked learning about chess psychology.There is a lot of study material on tatics, openings (it tells you how to prepare openings and gives you a complete system is very well thought out and useful), endgames and games from top kid champions that the author trained himself.I had as my first book on chess CHESS FOR JUNIORS. WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS continues with the tatics, openings and endgames from CHESS FOR JUNIORS.Do you want to really improve quickly?

This was to improve my game and to make me perform better in tournaments. I had a lot of books that just had materials to learn from. But I wanted to know what to study, how to study and then when I get to the tournament what to do to put me in the best shape.WELL, WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS, WAS THE BOOK I WAS LOOKING FOR. Not only did it cover all of those things, but it has some really cool material for actuall study. It was fun too because it used funny true stories like about the ""Chess Genie"" and what other kids try and do to disburb you while you play.But I liked also the stuff about the rules that isn't told to you in the rule book. And the parts about how the thinking processes make typical mistakes. This book shows you using real positions from actual games where you typically make mistakes under chess psycology.Though if you just want lots of great materials on endgames to study, a set out opening system (completely outlined), lots of tactical problems that are the most important to learn, then for this alone this book is great. I agree with the other reviews who say there is not another chess book like this one.Want to improve? Want to know how and what to study? Want some great material for study? Golly, I love this book (I do think the picture of the two kids on the front cover is cheesy and staged, so I am glad I didn't judge this book by the cover as I am certain those kids did not know anything about chess but the girl is cute and the boy is dorky looking).",5a044f3b-5c72-38e5-9af9-d5f8e36a0014,1608,115

Francis,74/74,5.0,1117843200,Gained 200 Rating Points Immediately!!!,"I attribute the 200 point increase in my rating to what I got out of this book. I purchased WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS in November, 2004. By mid April, 2005 my rating had jumped 200 points. I have been playing chess for many years and never had seen my game improve so quickly.This the best book written for a chess player rated over 800 who wants to see an immediate improvement in their results. I am going to break down how this book helped me improve:a. It gave me some nice ideas on how to condition myself. This helped me focus on the actual games and I was in good shape.b. Most players think they know the rules well. However, there is some great information pointing out some important things that are tricky. I won a game alone simply because I understood a rule better. It isn't the official rule book, but it tells you about the most important rules that players have problems with.c. I enjoyed learning about Psychology in chess. The three main immages that cause you to make mistakes (""retained"", ""intert"" & ""forward image"") well help you understand what is wrong with your thinking! If you don't know these immages you need to get WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS for this alone! Motivation, Self Confidence and Playing the Board Instead of The Person are fantastic parts of the section on Chess Psychology that everyone should know. I attribute the confidence I gained and knowing the most common problems I was having to part of my improvement.d. Preparing an Opening system was extremely useful. It tells you what to do and what to look for in your own personal opening system. It provides has about 8 full pages of charts of a suggested system that is very well thought out. Certainly not a complete opening book, but when you combine these charts with the author's other two excellent books, UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS and MORE UNBEATABLE CHESS FOR JUNIORS you learn the ideas behind the openings and individual moves. I learned some new opening lines and was able to organize them for study. I attribute my improved openings to wins in at least two games!e. A Mini-Tactics Workbook is provided in the segment on ""Pattern Recognition"". This segment tells you how to study tactics and gives you about 130 of the most important positions to know for practical use. There are also some mini-games containing important tactics that build upon each other. This is a very well organized part of the book. Ah! Well, I directly used several of the tactics I learned here to pull off some nice wins!f. Endgames! The segment on endgames avoids covering the very most basic endgames that the author covered in his excellent beginner's book, CHESS FOR JUNIORS. The author continues with the most important endgames that a player should know in a nicely condenced form. In one game I reached a position with King, Knight and Bishop against a lone King. I did the checkmate I learned from this book (I would never have stood a chance if I didn't read it in this book).g. The author's national champions gives their games and the stories behind their ability. Though, the least instructive part of the book (don't get me wrong the games are still instructive!), it was one of the most enjoyable parts of the book.h. Humor and Style. You would think that a book covering these subject is dry and boring. NO WAY! The author's use of humor that ties into the material is wonderful. Take a look at the ""chess genie"" story on page 180 and the last paragraph on page 32 (some funny things kids do that distract an opponent).If you don't own a copy of WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS and want to improve then this book is a MUST!",42dd1fac-1367-3bee-a700-155bea8db5e2,3659,74

He not only recounts war and the charnel houses of these two battles, but does it in a way that is both extremely moving in a prose style that is very reminiscent of the Robert Graves' WWI ""Goodbye to all That"" or WWII's Farley Mowat's ""And No Birds Sang.""Sledge, who is not a professional writer like the above gentleman but writes, in my opinion, equally as well. As such Sledge has written the quintessential experience of the Marine in the Pacific War. it is one of the best, eloquent, haunting, and poetic reads I have every come across, and more than most war memoirs it is very, very scary.I think that one should be able to read through it quickly. I also liked it cause I ended up clawing through the jungle in the Horseshoe region on Peleliu and seeing nothing but gun positions, caves, and small human shaped holes in the coral landscape with Sake Bottles and used and unused cartridges in the holes.I took this book to Peleliu in 1998. The Jungle has mostly come back and there are few tourists on the Island, and none off the very few trails. The caves are littered with broken Japanese Army helmets, some rusted badly, others with the green in good condition.One can see nothing but jungle cleaved coral. After passing the usual ""squid pots"" (what the Japanese called the small coral caves and holes the dot the island), I was suddenly standing on an old oil drum, now rusted the same colour as the brown moss of the jungle. Then another drum.... rows of drums filled with coral. About at least 50 of them lined to a depth of three of four-deep covering the entrance to a coral cave. The front of the drums were torn and shredded by large calibre fire -- probably .50 calibre I surmise by the size of the holes. Despite its layers of armour I could not help but think that the Marines probably knocked the position out early, though it would have done them little good,as this position was covered by innumerable others.Sledge describes the caves and squid pots all up to the top of the ridge. Day after day the Marines in Sledges unit went into this horror. Okinawa was Peleliu magnified 10 times -- and they were dehumanised by the entire experience to a degree that those who have never, perhaps today few ever can, experience such a degree of fighting.It should be noted that the Marines and, later, the Army siezed the ridge after 4 months of fighting. 10,000 Japanese soldiers and about 2000 Americans died on this island 3 Miles Long and 1 mile wide. I came across their bones --- femurs, skull shards, and shredded bodies all over the island. All along I had Sledge's book to keep me dark company.And so I recommend you the book. In the same way that Robert Graves kept me company in my wet soujourns to Vimy Ridge and Ypres in Belgium, so too did Sledge keep me company in that hot hell in the South Pacific.",c36214ea-2b84-3daf-8b2d-a36817d1b80d,3007,613

Russell,342/357,5.0,946944000,This book on combat ranks in the very highest tier.,"This account by E.B. Sledge, a Marine PFC who landed on Peleliu andOkinawa, details the violence and brutality of these two battles sorealistically that it is a disturbing and haunting book. Peleliu wassupposed to last 3 to 4 days, but went on for 2 months and cost theMarines 1,262 dead and 5,274 wounded. The statistics from Okinawacontain a action, and 26,221 neuropsychiatric &quot;non-battlecasualties.&quot; At Peleliu, Sledge &quot;had tasted the bitterestessence of war, the sight of helpless comrades being slaughtered, andit filled me with disgust.&quot; Peleliu was a jagged coral islandwhich caused cuts and tears on contact with human flesh, and there wasa lot of such contact. &quot;It was almost impossible to dig aprotective foxhole in the rock.&quot; Once inland one's senses wereoverwhelmed by the sight and smell of corpses filled with maggots,human excrement on top of coral everywhere, dysentery, rottingAmerican and Japanese rations, huge flies, knee deep mud, rainstorms,tropical oven heat, snapping bullets, and exploding shells. More thanonce Sledge saw a Marine slide down a ridge into rotting Japanesecorpses to find himself covered with maggots and vomiting from thesmell. Peleliu was an &quot;assault into hell;&quot; the landscape&quot;hell's own cesspool.&quot; After the landing, with Marinessuffering from heat prostration, even the water came from hell --itcame in old oil drums, and the oil residue caused the troops to retchin the broiling sun. When Sledge sees his comrades cutting gold teethfrom the Japanese--some while they are still alive--he is disgustedand sickened. But war, Sledge notes, made savages of them all, andone day Sledge finds himself bending over a Japanese corpse with aknife to cut out gold teeth. A corpsman tries to dissuade him, firstwith one argument and then another, finally succeeding by pointing outthe threat from germs involved. Relentlessly, Sledge and his comradesmove steadily forward, forward into the &quot;meat grinder,&quot;losing more and more men to injury and death, the grim&quot;inevitable harvest.&quot; The sight of dead Marines who had beentortured and mutilated by the Japanese hardens Sledge and his comradesagainst the enemy. Sledge tells of the terror of walking across anopen field facing Japanese machine gun fire while at the same timereceiving friendly fire from the rear from a Marine tank. But therewas something &quot;Artillery is hell,&quot; and of all the terrors,&quot;the terror and desperation endured under heavy shelling are byfar the most unbearable.&quot; Sledge learned to steer clear of anyand all second lieutenants, who invariably did not know what they weredoing and were highly dangerous to the troops. Sledge made twoamphibious landings on Peleliu and one on Okinawa. The rulerecognized among the troops was that if you made more than twolandings you had used up your luck. Even so, Sledge was one of lessthan 10 in his company of 235 men to escape alive andunwounded--thereby beating the &quot;mathematics of death.&quot;(&quot;Statistically,&quot; Sledge tells us, &quot;the infantry unitshad suffered l50 per cent casualties in the two campaigns.&quot;)Dr. Sledge, who is now a college biology professor, writes: &quot;Waris brutish, inglorious and a terrible waste. Combat leaves anindelible mark on those who are forced to endure it. The onlyredeeming factors were my comrades' incredible bravery and theirdevotion to each other.&quot; From Sledge's viewpoint, Peleliu andOkinawa were very close battles. His experience showed him that thesuccess of the Marines was grounded on their discipline, esprit decorps, tough training, the ability to depend on one's comrades, andboot camp, which developed an expectation to excel, even understress. Of all the books on combat, this ranks in the very highesttier. Reading it is an experience--a new and terrible experience--ofwhat Marine infantrymen went through during and after an amphibiouslanding in the Pacific in World War II. Without Marines likeDr. Sledge, who put their arms and legs and lives on the line in thesesavage battles, history would have taken a far different course. I,for one, am profoundly grateful for what he and his comrades did, andwant to thank him for what he endured. We owe him and his comradesmore than we realize.",e263ce76-f3aa-3109-afb6-4920e973c95a,4304,342

Sledge writes an autobiographical and historical account of his own experiences as a member of K Company, Third Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Marine Division. Coming late to the war in 1944, Sledge ""only"" participates in two of the famous 1st Marine battles - Peleliu and Okinawa. Throughout his account he speaks of his training, the closeness of combat and the horrors of war.After initially enlisting in the Marines in 1942, Sledge enrolled in Marine ROTC but like may others in his class, he felt the call of the war and after a semester he went to boot camp. It was here that he got his first taste of Marine training. By this time the Marines had plenty of combat veterans who had been rotated home to fill the ranks of instructors. The effect of having veterans train the newest can be measured by their initial survival in combat. The instructors prepared Sledge and his peers well with tough, realistic training - training that would keep them alive in the first days in combat. His state side training was followed up with more once he reached the Pacific and a healthy dose of iron discipline. Again, the hard training paid off for Sledge. Later in the war the Marines ran out of time for proper training and integration of new troops. The result was dead Marines, to new to know what to do. Training and discipline were the difference between life and death in the initial days in combat. Sledge received and absorbed his training and went home without a scratch.Though Sledge does not specifically address it, I was struck by the closeness of the combat he faced. Peleiu was a only 12 square miles - 6 miles long by 2 miles wide. Given that the average artillery piece of the day could range more than 6 miles, Peleiu was a division sized knife fight that lasted 30 days. 30 horrible days of almost non-stop fighting. Even when sent to the ""rear"" artillery and snipers were a constant danger. Okinawa was more of the same but on a larger scale. 60 miles long and between 2 and 18 miles wide, the Americans put a Field Army up against more than 100,000 entrenched Japanese. The vast majority of the island was covered by indirect fire and snipers were again a constant danger. Multiple Corps fought side by side where the island was barely 3 miles across. That anyone survived let alone prevailed through 80 days of bullets filling the air is amazing.Unlike many military writers who only saw combat in pictures, Sledge was there. He writes a Marines thoughts in Marine words. And unlike writers who wax poetic about the intense experience of men under fire, Sledge repeatedly calls warfare what it is - a waste. A waste of men and material. A destroyer of lives and land. The only good he finds in his service are the friendships that were born and continue. Okinawa is an ""abyss"" and he tells of a battlefield so littered with dead that pieces of flesh fly with the shrapnel and mud flung by exploding artillery and mortars. He recalls a friend tricking him into not pulling the gold teeth out of a dead corpse by warning him of germs. Only later does he realize that his friend was trying to save his soul not his health.When old men sit and decide to send young men to kill and be killed, they should be forced to read Sledge's words. War not only kills but also justifies killing. There are times and places where there is no other way. Times when the greater good can only come from the horror of war. But those times are few and I doubt someone like Sledge could find many after seeing first hand what war does to both those who die and those who survive.",0563f088-16a8-3f7b-80fc-aa1ecd52b561,3708,61

Dr. Sledge is an excellent source on the subject of Marines in combat in WWII. Dr. Sledge was really there at Peleliu and Okinawa, and on the front lines. No post-war historian could possibly describe the realities of combat with the accuracy of one who was really there. This book is a treasure not only because of its accuracy, but because it is so rare. Bookstores today are full of first-person accounts of Vietnam War veterans, but similar writings by veterans of WWII are extremely rare. If you want to read a generalized, sanitzed version of combat in the Pacific war, pick up a typical history book. However, if you want a definitive description of young American Marines fighting the ghastly horrors of combat-the worst reality of war-then this book is a must read. In my opinion, books such as this should be mandatory reading for high school students, so that they might have some understanding of how many Americans have fought and died to preserve the freedoms they now enjoy.",3aa89e3f-92fe-332e-b5de-b4f3c27e55d5,1057,54

Of the 9000 Marines who landed on the island's shores, 1 out 7 were dead within 24 hours. Ocean water was dyed red to 4 feet out. On shore, and weighted down with 90 pounds of survival gear and weaponry, men ran and fired and fought in 110-degree heat, with no water to drink. And that was only the beginning.Accounts of organized slaughter abound, from Thucydides' &quot;History of the Peloponnesian Wars&quot; to the Civil War's &quot;Andersonville,&quot; from Leon Uris's factual writings shaped as novels to Canada's Farley Mowat in his 40-years-after-the-war eloquent memoir &quot;And No Birds Sang,&quot; and to Larry Heinemann's wrenching exposures of Viet Nam. All these writings are unspeakably moving, and when we close the covers, we think we understand ... until we come across a book like that of E.B. Sledge.The accounts of Dr. Sledge touched me immeasurably of their own accord but also because I once loved a casualty of that South Pacific island's horrors, who, unfortunately, never quite found a way back to normalcy. I was too young and self-involved to comprehend. As he continued his fateful journey into alcoholism, my own soul stiffened and I left that tortured man.Twenty-six years later I sought out Dr. Sledge, and after some time found a way to reach him. His words, in a letter to me, ought to be shared. Dr. Sledge wrote that his physician father offered advice that put Sledge ""on the road to a postwar life of happiness and success."" Some of the advice was this: ""Don't ever feel bitter or sorry for yourself. You served your time in Hell, but you survived.""Survive he did, and well. Dr. Sledge went on to earn degrees in science and to become ""Uncle Eugene"" to his friends on the Alabama campus where he taught biochemistry and zoology. &quot;Science was my salvation,&quot; he told me. &quot;When combat memories bore down on me I lost myself in a difficult problem [in science].""Read his noble book.

Somehow, the book vanished along the way, probably during a family move about 30 years ago. I was crushed by its loss and tried to find another copy, but no one seemed to be able to find it.

But still I wished I could share &quot;Shadow Castle&quot; with her, as I knew she would love it as I had.Tonight, I logged on to Amazon.com to search for another book, but typed in &quot;Shadow Castle&quot; on a whim. I almost fell off my chair when I realized the book was truly available and that I was not alone in my search. After reading all of the reviews to my (now 19-year-old) daughter, I realized this book has a mysterious quality of disappearing once someone becomes attached to it. So I have ordered two copies, one for me and one for my daughter. Hopefully, at least one of them will still be found when she has children of her own to pass the story on to. I look forward to that, and am grateful to Amazon for reprinting this wonderful book, and allowing Mica, Gloria, Lucy, Bluebell, and all the rest to live again.",e7182f58-a6f7-3e78-81e7-5d4fe0c7a0dd,1791,34

To my shock and amazement, I started reading some of the reviews and saw names like, &quot;Bluebell&quot;, &quot;Robin&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot;. It all came back to me--flooding my memory not only with the details of the book, but the feelings I felt as a 12 year old girl when I read this wonderful magical enchanting book! It had the PERFECT elements of romance, fantasy, hope and excitement. The characters were SOOOO real--I know I'm gushing but it's because I'm so excited about finding this treasure of a book.

This book contains all of the usual elements in a traditional fairytale---a princess abducted by an unpleasant suitor, goblins, a dragon, enchantments, battles between the forces of good and evil---but it is very different from the impersonal stories in typical fairytale books.

My copy is now starting to fall apart, and I was so desparate to preserve the book I was considering retyping the entire book on my computer (although I wasn't looking forward to such a tedious task). You can imagine my excitement when, out of curiousity, I happened to type in the name of the book on a search engine and your site came up showing the book as being available, and in hard cover too! Now, I won't have to worry about the book falling apart. Although I still intend on purchasing several copies, just in case. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the other reviewers thoughts on the book, as well. My husband and I do not yet have children, but when we do, I will be sure to pass on the enjoyment this book has given me and apparently so many others. Thank you so much for making this possible.",5bb4f077-42ff-358a-b611-dfbbfce02dfe,2123,9

When my son was old enough I gave him a copy of the book with a genuine lion's paw shell and we spent hours discussing it. I am so pleased to see that my admiration for Robb White's novels is shared by so many. As I child I spent months collecting everything he wrote, including his memoir Our Virgin Island, which tells the story of how he and his young wife built a home on a then remote hunk of rock and sand in the British Virgin Islands. Years later I visited and stayed in that house, by then converted into a wonderfully raffish hotel named Marina Cay.",23e38a73-2f85-3072-8513-6fae3c717bab,692,9

What a great story! My parents took the family all over South Florida so I had the wonderful shock of finding that Sanibel Island, Lake Okechobee and the Calusahatchee River were REAL PLACES! I grew up in the Boy Scouts canoeing all these places and now have a kayak tour business in the Everglades and the Bahamas (ibistours.com). My Dad and I built a wooden, sailing, pram while I was in elementary school, and I had many great years of sailing and paddling it. I have spent a lifetime on the water and I am still drawn back to the magical scenes from the Lion's Paw. After my father died, I had a dream of walking the beach at Sanibal looking for the Lion's Paw that would bring him back. In all my years of walking beaches with my head down, I still have not found the elucive shell. Cannot think of a better book to encourage children to be couragous and self reliant. It would make a great movie.",be3714e9-896b-39d9-8339-f04b6837bbd0,1013,8
