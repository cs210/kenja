Extra TODOs:
- filter out low rated books (use google or amazon review values)
- only use reviews from amazon that give a rating of 3 or above



- only 5796 books considered right now

*** Notes *** : 
- there are books that have isbn values but no title --> make sure to ignore these
- number of unique titles -> 212404
- number of unique isbn values -> 221790
- the id does not necessarily correlate to an isbn, but often does
    - I think that if the id starts with a value that is not a number, this means that it is not an isbn
      and is just Amazon's assigned value --> we will ignore these values and only work with books that 
     start with numerical values
    - upon further investigation it appears (by just checking manually) that the above assumption is
      correct, however the same book can still have the same isbn number --> this only occurs for 
      3237 books out of 138,960 so in these cases we will make the assumption for now that the books are
      the same and just pick one of the isbn values
    - note that we will assume that no two books can have the same title (not sure if this is true, can
      only be a problem if the 3237 books above are actually different)
      - upon further investigation, popular books like harry potter are being tagged with these non-isbn ids
       these ids are the Amazon product numbers, or ASIN
- we will only consider books that have all values filled out in books_data.csv --> reduced number to *** 40635 *** books
- Adding the restriction of only considering isbns --> number of books is reduced to 26522
    - 832 books have multiple isbns, however, so the true value is 25,690
- upon further reflection, we have removed ratings count as a requried value for google, but will be keeping description

New notes:
- Ok, so it seems like books that do not have an ASIN and are being tracked with their isbns are actually the more obscure books,
  so switched to including ASIN values and got a TON more options (when using isbn --> none of the books had more than 1 review. Now,
  more than 60,000 books have 5 or more reviews)
- probably want to filter on genre more specifically at some point (only filtering out books with no genre label right now)
- Note: these values are for not fitlering out reviews with a rating less than 3:
    - at least 10 reviews: 33291
    - at least 15 reviews: 22880
    - at least 20 reviews: 17321
    - at least 25 reviews: 13760
- Note: filtering out reviews that are less than 4
    - at least 25 reviews: 10832
- Filtering out reviews that are less than 3:
    - at least 25 reviews: 12,077
- Filtering out reviews that are less than 4 and books with an average review rating less than 4:
    - at least 25 reviews: 8651
- Filtering out reviews that are less than 4 and books with an average review rating less than 4.2:
    - at least 30 reviews: 5796 books
- Need to make sure to filter out bad books later (my assumption right now, though, is that books with many reviews will have ok ratings)
 - will just remove reviews that are less than 3 for now as to not confuse the model
